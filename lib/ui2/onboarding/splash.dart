// The cold-start cover.
//
// AppState's init (SQLite open, migrations, first derive check) is the slow
// part of a launch and it happens before anything can be drawn honestly. This
// covers exactly that window and cross-fades out the instant the gate leaves
// `loading`. Shown once per launch; it latches itself off afterwards so a later
// rebuild never re-covers a running app.
//
// The cover is a glyph and a word on the page background — nothing to decode,
// nothing to buffer, no frame the launch waits on. It used to be a bundled
// video, which put an asset load and a codec on the critical path of the one
// moment the app is already slowest.
