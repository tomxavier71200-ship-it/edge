// Settings, and editing the profile.
//
// Two deliberate departures from the reference design:
//
//   · "Log out" is "Reset all data". Logging out of an app with no server is
//     theatre — it clears a session that does not exist while leaving every
//     byte on disk. The destructive action here is the honest one, and it says
//     what it destroys.
//   · Email, username, bio, location and date of birth are gone from the edit
//     form. None of them feed a metric, and a field that changes nothing is a
//     field that implies an account.

// ══════════════════ NOTIFICATIONS ══════════════════
//
// There are exactly three things this app may put in your notification shade:
// the alarm, the day's aggregated exception, and the weekly lookback when the
// week contained something. The app used to be able to emit around twenty-two
// kinds — hydration slots, step goals, posture nudges, AI briefings — and none
// of them had a switch anywhere in the app, so the only way to stop any of it
// was the OS. A notification the user cannot turn off is a bug, which makes
// this screen part of the fix rather than a nicety on top of it.
//
// The alarm is deliberately not switchable here: its off switch is cancelling
// the alarm, and burying a second one in settings is how an alarm silently
// fails to wake someone.
//
// The water reminder is on this screen and IS a shade entry — a strap buzz and
// a phone notification at the same minute, because a buzz alone needs a live
// link and a live isolate and so is not a reminder. It reminds you to LOG a
// drink — the app measures no hydration and this screen may never imply it
// does. See MT-14 in IDEAS.md.

// ══════════════════ AUTOMATION ══════════════════
//
// THE TWO PLATFORMS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC AND THIS SCREEN SAYS SO.
//
// Android gets real outbound event triggers: the app broadcasts an intent an
// automation app can start a profile on. iOS does NOT — there is no public
// mechanism for a Shortcuts personal automation to trigger on an arbitrary
// app-donated intent; that trigger list is a fixed system set, and
// `donate`/INInteraction buys Siri suggestions and discoverability, not an
// event trigger. So the iOS half of this screen names what iOS can do (invoke
// the app) and what it cannot (be invoked by it), rather than describing the
// Android feature in language vague enough to read as parity.
//
// And nothing that leaves here is a measurement. A Shortcut that receives
// `readiness=0` has recreated the fabricated-number problem outside the app,
// where there is no tier and no note to explain it — so the one event that
// ships carries facts about the SYNC and no metric at all.
