// The component gallery, and the one set of fixtures behind it.
//
// Two things live here, and the second is the reason for the first.
//
//   · [galleryCases] — every reusable component in lib/ui2, built once, with
//     a name. `test/ui2_golden_test.dart` shoots the same map, so the picture
//     on the phone and the picture in the goldens cannot describe two
//     different design systems.
//   · [GalleryScreen] — that map on a real device, at a real text scale, in
//     both themes. Every layout bug this project has shipped lived in one of
//     those two dimensions, and neither is visible on a laptop at 1.0×.
//
// The fixtures are deliberately the LONGEST realistic value for every slot,
// never the tidiest. Three shipped bugs — cards overflowing at 2.0×, a status
// row that fitted only the word "Connected", a greeting baked in the evening
// so the morning branch never rendered — were all invisible because the
// example was two characters long and the happy branch.
//
// Nothing here reads the database, the band or the repository: a gallery that
// needs data is a gallery nobody opens on a fresh install.
