// The chart painters.
//
// Two rules run through this file and neither is negotiable.
//
// 1. NOTHING IN HERE INVENTS DATA. The prototype these are ported from seeded
//    a `Random` inside several painters so the design could be seen without a
//    band attached. That is exactly the failure mode the honesty contract
//    exists to prevent, so every painter now takes the series it draws. A
//    painter given an empty series draws nothing and the screen shows a
//    `StatusCard` — it never draws a plausible-looking line.
//
// 2. A CHART WITHOUT AN AXIS IS A SHAPE. Every painter that maps a value to a
//    height takes an optional [AxisSpec]. Given one it uses exactly that
//    mapping — no padding, no auto-extent — so the gridlines and tick labels
//    `ChartFrame` prints are the same scale the curve was drawn against, and
//    two charts side by side are comparable. Without one it falls back to
//    auto-scaling its own min/max, which is fine for a sparkline and a lie
//    anywhere a number is being read off the picture.
//
// 3. A GAP IS A GAP. A sample that is `null` — or non-finite — means no
//    measurement exists at that position, and every painter here breaks its
//    path there rather than drawing a segment across it. A line joining 4 Aug
//    to 11 Aug asserts a week that was never measured, which is a fabrication
//    and not a rendering choice.
//
//    The x position of a sample is its INDEX, so the caller owns the time
//    base. Hand these painters a DENSE series — one entry per day, per minute,
//    per epoch, with `null` in the holes — and x is linear in time for free,
//    which is also what lets `ChartFrame.xLabels` describe a real date range.
//    A ragged "only the days we have a row for" list is what produces the
//    fabrication, and no parameter here can rescue one.
//
// 4. EVERY PAINTER THAT CAN RECEIVE A LONG SERIES DOWNSAMPLES. A night of
//    1 Hz data is ~30 000 points on a ~350 pt wide chart. The old UI handed
//    all 30 000 to `Path`, which is ~85 segments per physical pixel: invisible
//    work, visible jank. [minMaxColumns] reduces to at most two points per
//    horizontal pixel — the column's minimum and maximum, in time order — so
//    the drawn envelope is pixel-identical to the full series and every spike
//    survives. Naive stride decimation would drop them.
