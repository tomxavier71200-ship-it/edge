// HOME — decision-oriented. "What matters today?"
//
// Three rings that decide the day — what the night gave back, what the day has
// cost, what the night was made of — three signals worth a glance under them,
// and the small set of things the app can honestly say are worth doing. The
// hard part is not the circles: readiness exists on 71 % of days and needs
// four prior nights before it exists at all, so what a ring does with nothing
// in it is the design. See [RingTrio]. No insight feed and no general
// health-observation card: those are OBSERVATION, and observation lives on
// Health. A home screen that also observes is a dashboard, and a dashboard is
// what this rebuild is replacing.
//
// ONE NAMED EXCEPTION, and it is deliberately not a crack in that rule: the
// illness watch ([_bodyWatch]). It is not a feed and it cannot grow into one —
// exactly one detector may render here, it renders only when its own state is
// amber or red, and it is silent on every ordinary day. The reason it earns
// Home is timing rather than importance: the watch is at its most useful when
// it first goes amber, and amber has no notification, so before this the
// earliest signal the app produces could only be found by opening Health and
// scrolling. A signal that arrives too late to act on is not worth computing.
// If a second observation ever wants this slot, the answer is no — build the
// feed on Health where the others already live.
//
// This file also carries the plumbing every screen in this folder shares —
// navigation, the repo handle, and the three ways a value arrives from the
// data layer. They live here rather than in a fourth file because there are
// only three of them and they are read together.
