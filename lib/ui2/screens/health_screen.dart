      // burn" — a bar like the against-your-usual ones. Three measurements
      // killed it, in order of how hard they kill it:
      //
      //   1. INTAKE. `food_entry` (nutrition_store.dart) does not exist in any
      //      real database on hand, and `journal_metric` exists in one with
      //      zero rows. So the honest fill rate for logged days is 0, and
      //      `DayLogState.partial` is the state a real log lands in most of the
      //      time by design — an occasion with no kcal is a VALID log and makes
      //      the day's energy a floor, not a total. Self-report is also under
      //      by 20-30% in free-living adults, which is the same size as the
      //      deficits anyone would be looking for. A balance computed off that
      //      is not a small error, it is the wrong sign about half the time.
      //
      //   2. BURN. `calories_total` is tier ESTIMATE, confidence 0.5: a Mifflin
      //      floor over the covered day plus a Keytel surplus over the wake
      //      span. On the real export it swings 2 454 - 4 545 kcal across a
      //      fortnight, and a barely-worn day still publishes a confident
      //      1 715 with 0 active. That daily swing alone is bigger than the
      //      imbalance a verdict would be claiming to see.
      //
      //   3. WEIGHT. It is one profile scalar here, not a series, so it can
      //      never be an against-your-usual bar. The trend that IS honest
      //      already exists somewhere better: `weightTrendEwma` drawn by the
      //      Journal weight screen, gaps left as gaps. Read the ceiling written
      //      above it in journal_fields.dart before reopening this — weekly
      //      scale noise is +/-1 kg and a 2 400 kcal weekly imbalance moves
      //      ~0.3 kg, so the residual is several times smaller than the noise
      //      it would have to be read out of. The 7 700 kcal/kg rule is a
      //      population approximation, never a personal constant.
      //
      // A bar drawn from any two of those three is arithmetic on a floor
      // wearing the costume of a measurement, and this screen exists to not do
      // that. If someone logs food completely for months AND weighs in
      // repeatedly, the thing to build is still not a verdict on the person.
