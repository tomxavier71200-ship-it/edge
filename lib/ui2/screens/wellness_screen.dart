// Wellness — softer than Health, same system.
//
// Health tells you what your body did. Wellness is where you tell it back, and
// where the app explains itself. Five sub-tabs: Mind, Recovery, Habits,
// Medication, Cycle. Cycle is a SUB-TAB and not a sixth shell tab — see
// `app_shell.dart`; anything that feels like a sixth domain belongs inside the
// domain that owns it.
//
// Three rules this screen exists to hold:
//   · Habits are a CONSISTENCY, never a streak. "5 of 7 days" cannot reset to
//     zero, so a missed day costs a day rather than costing everything.
//   · Adherence is a COUNT with its window stated, and a dose still ahead of
//     you today is in no denominator.
//   · There is no drug-interaction checking. The screen does not carry a card
//     saying so either — a disclaimer for a feature that was never offered is
//     still an advert for it.
