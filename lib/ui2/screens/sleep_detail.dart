// SLEEP — one question, answered in three seconds, then revealed by scrolling.
//
// "How did my night go?" → what happened → how it compares to YOUR nights →
// what stood out → the signals underneath → the one thing to do tonight. Same
// screen, layered by scroll depth; there is no advanced mode to switch into.
//
// There is no sleep score. No composite exists in the pipeline, and inventing
// one here would mean choosing weights in a UI file. What replaces it is the
// comparison every "86" is a lossy summary of: last night against the middle
// half of the user's OWN recent nights, per measure, with the night count
// attached. A quartile band needs no thresholds, no population norms and no
// constants — it is the user's own distribution, so it cannot be wrong about
// somebody it was never fitted to.
