// The activity summary — eight archetypes, eight centres of gravity.
//
// The rule the whole file exists to enforce: a strength session is NOT a run
// with the map removed. A run is a route coloured by pace; a hike is an
// elevation profile; a swim is a lap ladder; HIIT is an interval ladder; a
// match is heart rate and hard minutes. Same grammar — same cards, same type,
// same spacing — different defining object.
//
// A lift is the exception that proves it: it has NO defining visual object,
// because nothing here measures one. The muscle map that used to hold the
// slot was a static exercise→group table times the volume the user typed,
// painted onto a body — a picture that looks measured and is not.
//
// [ActivityResult] is the seam. Everything on screen comes out of it, every
// field is nullable or empty by default, and an absent field renders a
// StatusCard rather than a zero. That is not politeness: `sessions` has no
// distance, no lap and no set columns of its own, so several of these fields
// come from elsewhere (`workout_route`, `strength_set`) or not at all, and the
// screen has to be honest about it without falling apart.
