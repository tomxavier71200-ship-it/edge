// The poster — the share card for a session that actually went somewhere.
//
// The other styles draw the route as a line in a box, which is a shape. This
// one draws it on a real basemap, so the shape becomes a place: the streets
// you ran, at the scale you ran them. That is the whole difference, and it is
// only offered when the session has real coordinates behind it.
//
// The composition is a full-bleed photo with everything else in a left column
// over it: wordmark, activity, the one big number, the stats as a vertical
// list, the map, the stamp. A column reads top-to-bottom in one pass; the
// horizontal stat strip this replaced made three numbers compete for the same
// glance and gave the map the whole bottom of the card for a shape you can
// read in a third of it.
//
// Three rules this card is built around.
//
//   1. NOTHING ON IT IS INVENTED. Every posted running card in the world shows
//      cadence, elevation and weather; this stack measures none of the three
//      for a gen4 band from stored data, so none of the three is here. The
//      rows are the same `shareStats` list the other styles offer — the ones
//      the session genuinely has.
//   2. The photo is the USER'S. It is not fetched, not generated, not a stock
//      backdrop chosen by activity type. If they do not add one, the card is
//      the accent gradient and says nothing about where they were.
//   3. The map is credited. `kOsmAttribution` is drawn ON the map, and only
//      when there are tiles under it — see the licence note in tiles.dart.
//
// Like `ShareCard`, this is a PICTURE at a fixed size and does not inherit the
// reader's text scale: it is exported at one resolution and sent to someone
// else's phone, and a 2× card would export clipped for every recipient.
