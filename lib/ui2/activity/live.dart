// Same interaction grammar — one shell, one clock, one pause/stop control —
// with a completely different middle. That difference is the point of the
// file: what the user is asked for depends on what nothing can measure.
//
//   MEASURED    route, journey, power        nothing to type; sensors do it
//   ENTERED     strength                     load, reps, RPE, rest
//               laps                         + LAP, pool length, stroke
//               flow                         pose, hold, breath
//               match                        score
//               interval                     rounds run themselves
//
// Nothing in here invents a measurement. [LiveFeed] is the seam to the band —
// every field nullable, and an absent one renders as a StatusCard rather than
// a zero. Calories are the one derived number, and they are derived from the
// activity's published MET and the user's weight (never from nothing), which
// is why they carry estimated confidence everywhere they appear.
