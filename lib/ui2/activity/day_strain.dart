// DAY STRAIN — when the day's effort actually happened.
//
// `getDayStrain` was fully implemented and called by nothing. Everything drawn
// here was already computed and persisted: `series.strain_curve` (one point per
// WAKE MINUTE), the zone minutes, and `max_hr_used` — the ceiling the pipeline
// actually integrated against, printed rather than laundered into the score.
//
// The CURVE leads. The 0–21 is a summary of the curve, not the other way round:
// two days can land on the same number with completely different shapes, and
// the shape is the thing you can act on.
//
// What this screen deliberately does NOT draw:
//   * CTL/ATL/TSB. That is a fortnight of history and it already has a card one
//     tap away on the Workout tab. A day screen repeating it is noise.
//   * the resting heart rate TRIMP was anchored on. `getDayHeart`'s
//     `resting_hr` is now that same nocturnal number (`scalars.rhr` no longer
//     falls back to daytime HR), so it COULD be printed — it just does not earn
//     a line on a day screen whose subject is the curve. Naming the input in a
//     sentence is enough.
