// A row that scrolls, and admits it.
//
// `SubTabs` is a horizontal `ListView`, and its fifth entry lands off-screen
// on every phone we ship to. Measured, not guessed (see
// `test/ui2_scroll_hint_test.dart`, which holds the same numbers as an
// assertion): Wellness — Mind · Recovery · Habits · Medication · Cycle — wants
// 421 pt of chips inside the 358 pt the row actually gets on a 390 pt phone,
// so "Cycle" shows 3 pt of its own left padding and no letters. Health shows
// 19 pt of "Labs". At 360 pt both show exactly zero, and the row reads as if
// it simply ends at Medication / Vitals — which is how two finished screens
// went undiscovered by the person who built them.
//
// Not scrolling would be better than any affordance, so that was priced
// first, and it does not work. Cutting the chip padding from S.x4 to S.x2 —
// by which point it is not a chip — still leaves Wellness 13 pt over at
// 360 pt, and at 1.5x text every set is already half again wider than the
// viewport. The row has to scroll, so it has to say so.
//
// What it says: the tail of the content dissolves and a chevron sits at the
// edge, both scaled by how much is genuinely left to reach. Nothing is drawn
// at all when nothing is off-screen — no mask, no layer, no widget — and both
// are gone by the last pixel of the scroll. An edge treatment that is always
// on is decoration, and decoration that lies is worse than nothing.
//
// The chevron is not garnish on the fade. A fade only reads as "more" when
// there are glyphs under it to dissolve, and on a 390 pt phone the Health row
// clips 3 pt into "Labs" and Wellness 13 pt into "Medication" — both under
// the 40 pt tail, both nearly nothing to bite on. Fade alone was measured on
// that config and rejected there; the chevron is what carries it.
