// ── SUBSTRATE ADMISSION — the one predicate that decides what may become a
//    number ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE THREE PROVENANCE COLUMNS ON `decoded_onehz` / `decoded_rr`, AND THE RULE
// THAT THEY DO NOT OVERLAP:
//
//   device_id      WHICH UNIT.       '' is the primary band, permanently
//                                    (see [_createDecodedStore]); a real id
//                                    belongs to a secondary.
//   device_family  THE CALIBRATION KEY. Which sensor's constants a metric must
//                                    look itself up under. NULL = unknown, and
//                                    unknown is its own case, never gen4.
//   source         THE ADMISSION FLAG. NULL = the primary band. Non-NULL names
//                                    the adapter that wrote the row.
//
// None of the three is a stand-in for another. `source` in particular is NOT a
// provenance id you may read to find out what a row came from — `device_id` and
// `device_family` are — it exists so this file can answer ONE question in SQL:
// may this row become a number?
//
// Why an adapter's rows are stored but not derived by default: correctness of a
// community decoder cannot be enforced by review, and a decoder with a 2x scale
// error reads a resting 50 bpm as 100 and passes every generic physiological
// bound. So an unverified adapter's seconds bank, sync, back up and show up in
// diagnostics — and produce no metric at all until the owner has held that
// hardware in his own hands (ASSUMPTIONS R6/E5/E6). Silent, on purpose: the
// alternative is a plausible wrong number, which is the one failure this
// project treats as worse than an absent one.
//
// NOTE THE DIFFERENCE FROM MULTIBAND_PLAN §3.3, which said a verified adapter
// would write `source IS NULL` and so need no read-side change. It is written
// the other way round here — every non-band writer stamps its id, always, and
// ADMISSION IS A READ-SIDE DECISION — for two reasons that only show up later:
// verification is then REVOCABLE (a decoder bug found in v3 of an adapter is
// one edit to [kDerivableSources], not a data migration over rows that can no
// longer be told apart), and `source` keeps meaning something after a strap is
// verified, which is what lets [kPrimaryBandSourceSql] below still exist.

/// Non-NULL `source` values admitted to derivation: adapters the OWNER has
/// personally held and cross-confirmed (ASSUMPTIONS R6).
///
/// EMPTY TODAY, AND CORRECTLY SO. The only owner-confirmed band is the WHOOP 4,
/// which is the primary band and therefore writes `source IS NULL` — so the set
/// of *non-NULL* sources that may be derived from is genuinely empty, and
/// [derivableSourceSql] renders byte-identical SQL to the bare predicate it
/// replaced. It becomes non-empty the first time a strap earns it.
///
/// NOT the same set as `kOwnerConfirmedBandIds` in `ui2/profile/devices.dart`,
/// and deliberately not shared with it: that one holds BAND FAMILY ids
/// (`device_family`) and decides whether a badge says EXPERIMENTAL; this one
/// holds SOURCE values and decides whether a row may become a number. They
/// answer different questions off different columns and will diverge the moment
/// a family is decoded but its adapter is not yet trusted. Both are `ponytail:`
/// placeholders for the CODEOWNERS-gated `_verified.dart` (ASSUMPTIONS E5) —

    // (`[{t,v},…]`), grid (`{t0,dt,v[]}`) or offset (`{t0,to[],v[]}`) — see
    // data/series_codec.dart for why. Old rows keep their legacy shape forever,
    // so this view must read all three, and the branch guards are what keep a
    // row from being emitted twice: legacy requires an `array`, grid requires
    // `.dt`, offset requires `.to` AND no `.dt`. The codec never writes both,
    // but "never" is not enforced by the storage layer — a foreign or corrupted
    // curve carrying both fields matched the grid and offset branches at once
    // and silently doubled the curve. The `.dt` precedence also matches
    // SeriesCodec.decodeCurve, so SQL and Dart resolve an ambiguous curve the
    // same way rather than disagreeing.
    //
    // `latest` filters on json_valid first: json_extract raises on a malformed
    // document, and without the guard ONE corrupt payload fails the entire
    // v_series query instead of dropping that one day. Same guard, same reason,
    // as daysWithSleepTst.
    //
    // The grid branch needs no running sum because json_each exposes an array's
    // index as `key`, so t = t0 + key*dt. Verified row-for-row against the
    // pre-codec view on the three tracked bundle fixtures, including a database
    // holding both shapes at once (test/coach_views_series_shapes_test.dart).
    //
    // The offset branch walks `.v` ONCE and indexes into `.to` by that key. The
    // obvious form — json_each over `.to` joined to json_each over `.v` on
    // `key` — is quadratic: SQLite cannot index a table-valued function, so the
    // join degrades to a full cross product of the two and the cost grows with
    // the SQUARE of the curve length. hrv_day, hrv_timeline and resp_day are
    // all irregularly sampled and therefore all offset-encoded, so this is the
    // hot path, not a corner: on 365 real days a `SELECT AVG(v)` measured 877 ms
    // against 89 ms, and on 1440-point curves a 30-day slice took 2.1 s. The
    // `e.key < json_array_length(.to)` bound is what keeps the rewrite
    // row-for-row identical rather than merely equivalent on well-formed data —
    // the join emitted min(len(to), len(v)) rows, and without the bound a `to`
    // shorter than `v` would gain rows with a NULL `t`. Pinned by a query-plan
