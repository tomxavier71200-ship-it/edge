// ── live HR / IMU stream ownership (discussion #287) ─────────────────────────
//
// A foreground connection used to be an implicit request for BOTH the
// realtime-HR stream (opcode 3) and the 100 Hz IMU stream (gen5 opcode 106),
// and the enable / HR-only / disable methods each flipped the engine's live
// flags BEFORE their writes went out, with no serialisation between them. Two
// races followed from that: a breathing close started an OFF sequence
// unawaited, a workout starting inside that window saw "already enabled" and
// skipped its ON, and the older OFF then finished and left the workout without
// a stream; and a feature that started while another already had streams on
// recorded no ownership, so when both left nothing recomputed the remaining
// owner set and the keep-alive kept re-arming a flood nobody read.
//
// The fix is a desired-vs-applied reconciler: every consumer is an explicit
// owner ([LiveStreamOwners]), the policy below turns the owner set into two
// independent desired bits ([desiredLiveStreams]), and the engine walks the
// applied state towards the desired one a single transition at a time
// ([nextLiveStreamStep]). The engine is the only writer of these opcodes; the
// app never calls enable/disable, it only changes owners and nudges.

/// Which live streams are wanted or applied. OFF, HR-only, IMU-only and
/// HR+IMU are all representable — a three-state off / HR-only / full model
/// cannot express movement sampling without HR, and would arm the IMU flood
/// for breathing and non-gait workouts that only read beats.
