// BLE engine — the WHOOP 4.0 (Harvard) BLE transport, on flutter_blue_plus.
//
// REWRITTEN TRANSPORT (feat/ble-rewrite). The protocol/byte layer is unchanged:
// everything still goes through `package:openstrap_protocol` (framing/CRC, INIT,
// buildCommand, buildBatchAck, parseMetadata, decodeRecord/parseR24, constants,
// dangerousCmds). What changed is HOW we manage the link:
//
//   * One explicit connection state machine (`ble_state.dart`); the
//     flutter_blue_plus `connectionState` stream is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for
//     connected/disconnected — we never set "connected" by hand.
//   * A single in-flight guard (`_opLock`) so connect/reconnect/disconnect can
//     NEVER overlap (the classic flaky-connect bug).
//   * A per-connection `_Session` that owns the device, characteristics, the
//     three reassemblers, EVERY stream subscription, and the heartbeat timer —
//     torn down atomically on disconnect so nothing leaks across reconnects.
//   * A single LISTENING mode. Once the link is up we subscribe → SET_CLOCK →
//     INIT (which triggers the historical flood) → then JUST KEEP LISTENING.
//     Historical records and live records arrive on the SAME data stream; we ACK
//     every HISTORY_END marker as it comes and store every record. There is no
//     "syncing → live" flip, no live-edge cutoff, no idle-timeout that ends a
//     phase. The historical offload runs to HISTORY_COMPLETE (which is what
//     durably advances the band's read cursor — cutting it short was the
//     "Groundhog Day" re-flood bug); once complete the same subscription keeps
//     delivering live records with no mode change.
//
// SAFETY: we NEVER send a dangerousCmd (FORCE_TRIM 0x19 / REBOOT 0x1D /
// TOGGLE_PERSISTENT_R21 0x9A). Optical is wrist-gated (0x6B only).
//
// SEQ DISCIPLINE: live commands use the HIGH range (0xA0+); sync ACKs use the LOW
// range (5+, continuing from INIT 0..4). Allocated by `SeqAllocator` so they
// never collide.
//
// PUBLIC SURFACE consumed by AppState / background_sync / edge_tracking. The
// DerivationEngine no longer keys off a discrete "sync done" — instead the engine
// fires a debounced `onDataStored` callback after records are persisted (coalescing
// bursts), so the compute trigger survives the move to continuous listening.

      //      report a channel we don't know (protocol's `subChannelKnown` is

      //      without a normalisation nobody has validated.
      //   4. physiology. the diastolic peak is frequently absent in older

      // 76-byte v25 inner is the same record as gen5's v26 — 24 × i16 of
      // waveform — so there is no room in it for a gravity vector, and what
      // lives at 69/71/73 is the waveform's tail and a constant.
      //

      // that fall inside `decoded_onehz`'s retained range on that export,
      // 13,394 are ALREADY covered by a v24 record; exactly one is new in
      // 8.5 days. Recomputed over all 24 stored sleep windows, the observed
      // fraction (`sampled && hrNear`) moves +0.00 pp. The "1-5 pp lift"
      // SLP-05 sizes does not exist on real data.
      //
      // Worse, routing it here would be a REGRESSION: `_queueDecodedOneHz`
      // writes REPLACE on the rec_ts key, so a v25 record arriving for a
      // second a v24 record already holds would evict it — deleting that
      // second's HR, R-R, optical and thermal readings and leaving an
      // HR-less row behind. That is 49% of v25 records.
      //
      // The record genuinely has NO heart rate. Every byte and u16 offset was
      // scanned for anything in a bpm range with physiological drift across
      // 18k consecutive one-second pairs; the only matches are the packet type,
      // the timestamp's high bytes and a gravity high byte. What sits between
