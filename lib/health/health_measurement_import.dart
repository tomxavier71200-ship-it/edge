// Import measurements from devices that are CLEARED to take them.
//
// A blood-pressure cuff measures blood pressure. A CGM measures glucose. A
// thermometer measures core temperature. None of those is a thing this app can
// derive from a wrist, and the honest way for those numbers to sit next to your
// sleep is for the device that is allowed to measure them to measure them, and
// for us to show the reading with that device's name on it.
//
// ⚠️ READ-ONLY INPUTS TO DISPLAY. NEVER TRAINING TARGETS. ⚠️
// Read the guard on `_createImportedMeasurement` in db.dart. It is repeated
// there and here deliberately: the moment a cuff series and a wrist PPG series
// live in one database, the obvious next idea is to fit one to the other, and
// that idea is a cuffless-blood-pressure claim from an uncleared device. These
// rows may be shown beside ours. They may never be regressed against ours, and
// nothing derived may take one as an input.
//
// NEVER BLENDED. There is no combined series, no "your blood pressure" without
// the cuff's name on it, and no averaging of an imported reading with anything
// of ours. The source name is a NOT NULL column for that reason.
//
// This is the ONLY honest route to blood pressure or glucose in this app. Both
// are permanently refused as things OpenStrap computes.
