// health_export.dart — write each day's derived metrics to the platform health
// store: Apple Health (HealthKit) on iOS, Google Health Connect on Android.
//
// Honesty rule (same as the rest of the app): only export what the band/our
// pipeline measures or derives for real — sleep stages, resting HR, HRV
// (SDNN on iOS / RMSSD on Android), respiratory rate, active energy, workouts.
// NOT the proprietary scores (recovery/strain/readiness) or relative-only signals
// (SpO₂ / skin-temp) — no native type, would be fabricated.
//
// Continuous + idempotent: a day is exported AS SOON AS it's derived (no waiting
// for finalization). Because a recent day can re-derive, every export DELETES our
// prior samples for that day's window before writing fresh ones — so re-running
// never duplicates. Days in the contiguous FINALIZED prefix are immutable, so once
// exported they're skipped (tracked by the `health_export_through` cursor); the
// recent tail is re-written each pass until it finalizes.
//
// Nothing here throws — a missing/locked health store yields a HealthLinkState or
// a 0 count, never an exception.
