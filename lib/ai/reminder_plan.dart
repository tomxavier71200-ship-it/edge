// reminder_plan.dart — PURE policy: which AI-feature notifications should be
// on the OS schedule right now, and when. NotificationCenter executes this
// plan; nothing here touches the plugin, so the whole surface is unit-testable.
//
// Design constraint (iOS): BYOK network can't run reliably in the background,
// so a scheduled notification cannot carry model-written text. The nightly
// sweep works anyway, because the FINDING is computed on-device in pure Dart
// before the slot is armed: the notification body is the finding itself, and
// the model's take on it is written when the deep link is opened (or
// opportunistically on the next foreground).
