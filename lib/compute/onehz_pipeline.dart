// onehz_pipeline.dart — the PURE, isolate-safe per-day analytics pipeline (V2).
//
// `deriveDayBundle` is a top-level function with NO DB / IO / Flutter binding
// dependency, so it runs cleanly under `Isolate.run(...)` off the UI isolate.
//
// V2 INVARIANTS enforced here:
//   * SINGLE-SOURCE SLEEP. The day already carries ONE `SleepSegmentation`
//     (from analytics' segmentSleep, computed by the coordinator). Every sleep
//     figure — TST/WASO/efficiency/nrem/rem/wake/hypnogram — comes from THAT one
//     result. We never re-detect sleep or run a second estimator.
//   * WINDOWS ARE FIRST-CLASS. HRV/RHR/recovery run over the SLEEP window only
//     (the fix for the ~166 ms whole-day RMSSD bug). Strain (TRIMP) runs over the
//     WAKE span. Resp/ODI/CPC run over sleep. No metric runs over "the whole
//     capture".
//   * HONEST BY TYPE. Every output keeps the {value,confidence,tier,inputs_used}
//     Metric envelope; absent input → null/"—", never fabricated.
//
// CROSSING THE ISOLATE BOUNDARY (copied, not shared):
//   IN  : a serialized `DayBundleInput` (the day's sliced 1 Hz substrate arrays +
//         the precomputed sleep segmentation + the profile + baseline history).
//   OUT : Map<String,dynamic> (plain JSON) — the full derived bundle, envelopes +
//         the curve series the UI needs + indexed scalars. Survives jsonEncode.
