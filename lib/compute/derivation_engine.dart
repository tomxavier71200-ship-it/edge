// DerivationEngine — the on-device compute COORDINATOR (MAIN ISOLATE).
//
// Current flow (per trigger):
//   1. Decide WHICH calendar days need compute (force / pending span / latest
//      freshness-critical day).
//   2. Build / refresh the first primitive, `sleep_session_candidates`, from a
//      bounded overlap window only when needed.
//   3. Load the exact calendar-day substrate + exact sleep-window substrate for
//      the target day, then build one PreparedDerivationDay from those pieces.
//   4. Run the pure day pipeline off-isolate, then compute the second
//      primitive, `wake_day_features`, directly from the local-day substrate.
//   5. Persist day_result as the materialized UI surface, plus compact baseline
//      artifacts (`rolling_artifact`, `crossday_input`) for downstream reuse.
//   6. Run cross-day / notifications from those compact artifacts and prune raw
//      only after a force/full-history sweep, never before derived.
//
// Finalized-day rescans are still allowed for baseline-dependent scalars
// (readiness/recovery, illness/anomaly, stress), but they now gate off the
// rolling baseline artifact instead of recomputing the signature ad hoc from
// metric_series each time.

/// Analytics/bundle version — bump to force a recompute of non-finalized days.
/// v3: Walch 2019 stager + 4-class stages (light/deep/rem), robust nocturnal HRV,
/// 0–21 strain, skin-temp-z baseline fix, baseline-need signals.
/// v4: finalization + retention anchored on the DATA EDGE (last drained record
/// timestamp), not the wall clock — a buffer-and-sync band's wall-clock time is
/// irrelevant. Bumping resets per-version finalization so any day the old wall-
/// clock logic prematurely LOCKED (before its flash fully drained) re-derives.
/// v5: sleep HR-dip is confidence-only — no longer relocates onset. Validated on
/// real data: the old trim shoved a true 02:15 onset to 02:41, discarding ~26
/// min of real early sleep. Window onset now stands; stager decides wake within.
/// v6: replaced the Walch ML stager with a transparent cardiorespiratory rule
/// stager (motion + HR + RMSSD vs the night's own baseline). Walch over-called
/// wake (solid night read 60% eff) and ignored RR; the rule stager uses RR and,
/// on real data, lifts a true solid night to ~94–99% eff with a plausible
/// light/deep/REM mix. Honest ESTIMATE (conf scales with RR coverage).
/// v7: CALENDAR-day model (local midnight→midnight) replaces wake-to-wake. A
/// day's sleep = the main sleep that ENDED that morning; recovery follows into
/// the day, strain = that day's waking activity. Deletes the wake-scan day
/// boundaries / 36 h horizon / back-extension; recompute = the calendar day(s)
/// new data touches. Day keys are now plain calendar dates.
/// v8: STRESS (Baevsky SI, windowed median → 0–100 score) + relative SpO₂
/// (overnight desaturation index) now computed, persisted to day_result +
/// metric_series, and surfaced (Today tiles, stress screen, day/week/month/3M
/// trends). Stress validated on real data (SI ~47–52, low/normal resting).
/// v9: ACTIVITY-MINUTES — coarse 1 Hz movement proxy (wrist orientation change;
/// 1 Hz can't do ENMO/steps — Nyquist). Persisted + trended. Validated on real
/// data (~477 active min on a full day). True step counts remain live-IMU only.
/// v10: active calories (Keytel), HR zones, nocturnal nadir/waking, sleep-need
/// 8 h default; activeMin stored as double (fixes the int→double? derive crash).
/// v11: SLEEP CYCLES corrected to Rosenblum 2024 "fractal cycles" (HRV-adapted):
/// peak-to-peak of the smoothed per-minute RMSSD series, NOT categorical REM-
/// episode counting. Validated on real data (4 / 2 cycles, ~90–100 min each).
/// v12: nocturnal nadir INSTANT (`sleeping_hr_nadir_ts`) added so the card shows
/// "NADIR @ HH:MM" instead of "@ -"; seam-side, getDayStrain now routes the
/// cross-day EWMA-ACWR `load` to the strain detail. Full seam↔screen audit.
/// v13: computable gaps filled — HRV stability (CV) + Poincaré irregular-beat
/// screen (pipeline), and engine-injected blocks: wear segments, waking
/// daytime-HRV timeline, nocturnal restlessness, and sleep periods (main+naps).
/// v14: trend scalars for sleep-stage minutes (rem/deep/light/tst) + lf_hf +
/// hrv_cv (→ metric_series); per-5-min day `activity_curve` for the "Your day"
/// timeline. (Peak/lowest-HR + their @times are computed seam-side from the HR
/// curve, no derived change.)
/// v15: efficiency + worn_min scalars → metric_series (sleep-efficiency & wear
/// trends); + _trendKey fixes (resting_hr→rhr, skin_temp→skin_temp_z, sleep→tst_min).
/// v16: ADDITIVE analytics surfaced into the bundle — (a) an Edwards zone-sum
/// "effort" strain beside the 0–21 headline: NEVER SHIPPED, and removed
/// entirely at v68 — no producer was ever written, so `strain_effort` was a
/// permanently-null key in `metric_series`; (b) top-level `baselines` block: Winsorized-EWMA personal baselines (rhr/hrv/resp) with
/// z/delta/ratio + cold-start status; (c) `advanced_sleep` block: a 4-class
/// Cole–Kripke/DoG stager's main-session AASM metrics + hypnogram (parallel
/// ESTIMATE; the single-source `sleep` block stays the headline). Bumping
/// re-derives non-finalized recent days so the new blocks populate.
/// v17: STEPS (24/7 ESTIMATE = ambulatory-minutes × cadence, personalized by the
/// live 100 Hz pedometer's cadence calibration) + TOTAL DAILY ENERGY (TDEE via
/// HR-flex: Mifflin BMR floor + active Keytel surplus). New scalars `steps` +
/// `calories_total` → metric_series; `steps`/`calories_total` bundle blocks. 1 Hz
/// still can't COUNT steps (Nyquist) — real counts come from live streaming, which
/// also tunes this estimate. Bumping re-derives non-finalized days so they fill.
// v20: principled nap detection (van Hees immobility + HR-dip) → `naps` block +
// `nap_min` scalar; cross-day Sleep Coach (need/bedtime/cycle-wake/performance),
// Strain Coach (recovery-gated target), VO₂max + Fitness Age, all in the crossday
// bundle.
// v21: all-day HRV line (`series.hrv_day`, epoch rolling RMSSD over 24/7 RR).
// v22: all-day RESP line (`series.resp_day`, rolling RSA br/min) + relative
// SKIN-TEMP trend (`series.skin_temp_day`) for the Timeline graph.
// v23: all-day HRV (`series.hrv_day`) now rejects ectopic/missed-beat pairs
// (Malik 20% rule) + clips to ≤220 ms, killing the non-physiological 400+ ms
// spikes.
// v24: picks up the analytics sleep-algorithm rewrite (multi-session detection +
// bridging + main-session pick via AdvancedSleepStager). Bumping re-derives
// non-finalized days so past nights restage; "Re-analyze data" restages all.
// v25: 24/7 irregular-rhythm SCREEN (day-span RR → `irregular_rhythm_flag` +
// notification), heart-rate recovery (HRR) per auto-detected bout → `hrr_bpm`,
// breathing-rate variability (`brv_cv`/`brv_slope`), opt-in auto-workout
// SUGGESTIONS (workout_suggestions table + notification), and low-confidence
// WRIST ORIENTATION during sleep (NOT body position). Bumping re-derives
// non-finalized days; "Re-analyze data" restages all.
// v26: integration bump — the oxygen/workout PR externalized active-calorie
// compute to `Calories.activeEnergy` (Keytel + height term) without a version
// bump; combined with the v25 features above, bump so finalized days recompute
// onto the new calorie formula instead of silently carrying the old values.
// v27: WEAR fix — worn-time / coverage / on-off segments were defined as hr>0,
// which misreads daytime PPG drop-out as off-wrist and collapsed a 24 h-worn day
// to ~the sleep window (~7-8 h). Wear is now RECORD presence (gap-detected), in
// both the `worn_min` scalar (onehz_pipeline) and the `_wearBlock` detail. Bump
// so finalized days recompute the corrected wear ("Re-analyze data" restages all).
// v28: SLEEP rescue — manual sleep entry + HR-led fallback. When accel-led
// detection finds nothing, an HR-dip fallback now proposes a window (source
// 'auto_fallback', low confidence); a user can type/confirm a window
// (sleep_override table → source 'manual'/'confirmed') which force-derives even
// a finalized day. Bump so fallback-eligible days restage.
// v29: COUNTER-RESET RECOVERY. The decoded substrate now dedupes by timestamp
// (rec_ts, newest-wins) instead of by the strap counter, which resets on reboot
// and silently quarantined every post-reboot day (empty "today", strain –). The
// DB v17 migration (_rebuildCanonicalDecodedStore) rebuilt decoded_onehz/
// decoded_rr time-keyed, the write path REPLACEs on rec_ts, and the substrate
// loader falls back to decoding raw_records directly for ranges whose decoded
// rows are absent — so previously-quarantined days now have data. Bump so those
// days (and any finalized day derived while data was missing) recompute against
// the recovered substrate.
// v32: SLEEP-STAGE fix — the REM detector depended on a respiration signal
// (`resp`) that no real caller ever supplied (WHOOP 4's R24 record has no
// respiration-ADC channel), so it was unconditionally NaN and the primary
// REM rule could never fire — nights collapsed to almost-all-light. Also
// resolved a three-implementation ambiguity (`cardioStager` vs
// `AdvancedSleepStager` v1/v2 — only v1 was ever actually wired, despite
// `cardioStager` being the one documented as fixing Walch 2019's WAKE-bias)
// via a head-to-head comparison; `cardioStager` (StagingMethod.cardio) is now
// the wired default. ALSO in this same (unshipped) bump: `dailyStepEstimate`'s
// doc had always promised a "run of >= minBoutMin consecutive ambulatory
// minutes" bout gate that was never actually implemented — every minute that
// individually passed the ENMO+HR gate summed directly into steps, so a
// handful of scattered, non-contiguous minutes overnight (a brief HR lift
// during a turn-over) could report several thousand phantom steps the moment
// someone woke up having never walked. `minBoutMin` (default 3) is now a real
// gate. Bumping re-derives non-finalized days so past nights/days restage;
// ALREADY-FINALIZED history needs "Re-analyze data" to pick up BOTH corrected
// staging and corrected steps — this is the one bump so far where that's
// worth actually telling users about, since it affects months of history,
// not just going forward.
// v37: SLEEP-STAGE fix #2 (real-device root cause, not synthetic) — v32 fixed
// the dead REM path but a real overnight capture showed cardioStager still
// massively over-called WAKE (~6h on a night truth was ~3min) and under-
// called REM (~40min vs a ~2h42m truth). Root cause: BOTH the motion
// ("gravity 1 g reference") and HR ("sleeping HR baseline") features were
// single WHOLE-NIGHT scalars. This real device's decoded gravity-vector
// magnitude is NOT perfectly orientation-invariant — different STATIC sleep
// postures read up to ~13% apart in |accel| despite near-zero within-epoch
// variance (i.e. genuinely still), so 389/421 "big move" epochs that night
// were this artifact, not real movement, and produced WAKE blocks too long
// for Webster rescore to bridge back. Separately, the whole-night HR arousal
// threshold misread the sleep-onset HR-decay transient (elevated HR for the
// first ~60-90 min while settling) as sustained arousal. `cardio_stager.dart`
// now computes both references as LOCALLY-ADAPTIVE rolling windows, plus a
// local p25 (not median) floor specifically for the REM gate — REM recurs on
// ~90 min ultradian cycles and is a minority of any local window, so a local
// MEDIAN self-dilutes from REM's own periodic elevation. Verified on the real
// capture: wake 294->1 min, light 173->337 min, deep 26->58 min, rem 41->139
// min, against an Apple Watch Ultra ground truth of wake=3 light=330 deep=38
// rem=162 min for the same night. Bump so this genuinely different (much more
// accurate) staging recomputes; "Re-analyze data" needed for finalized nights.
// v38: audit-fix sweep, two changes actually touch output. (1) analytics'
// `readinessLnRmssd` was including tonight's own value in its own baseline
// window (`historyLnRmssd.sublist(start)` ran to the end of the list instead
// of stopping before it) - pulled the mean/sd toward tonight, understating
// how far off a genuinely suppressed/elevated night reads, worst exactly
// when the window is smallest. Now strictly prior nights only, changing
// `readiness_lnrmssd`'s z/cv/value for every day. (2) day windows here used
// `_localDayLabelToSec(day) + 86400`, assuming every local day is exactly
// 24h - wrong on the two DST-transition days a year (23h/25h), which could
// clip or over-include a day's substrate window right at the boundary. Now
// `_localNextDayLabelToSec` asks DateTime for the actual start of the next
// day. Bump so recent days recompute onto the corrected readiness baseline;
// only matters for history on the rare day that crossed a DST transition.
// v39: night-tail sleep runs shorter than the 60-min standalone floor are no
// longer dropped when they continue the overnight chain (advanced_stager
// detectSleep) — a pre-dawn arousal that split off a <60-min tail was
// truncating the sleep-window offset at the arousal. Bump so affected days
// recompute the corrected (later) offset and downstream sleep/readiness metrics.
// v42: PERSONALIZED, self-improving cardio stager. (1) REM feature upgrades in
// cardioStager — LF/HF from the RR Lomb–Scargle spectrum + R(k)=mean|ΔIHR|,
// OR-combined with the RMSSD drop and gated by atonia + an HR floor (recovers
// under-called REM), plus a 3-epoch median flicker filter. (2) A rolling
// per-user sleep profile (baselines key `sleep_user_profile`) EWMA-folded after
// each finalized night and blended (bounded ≤0.5, growing with nights, 0 at
// cold start) with tonight's per-night-local baselines — so staging gets better
// over time while per-night-local always leads. Deep stays a low-confidence
// NREM sub-split (deep_low_confidence). The profile self-seeds across this
// re-derivation sweep; no explicit migration. Bump so every day re-stages.
// v43: readinessComposite now falls back to a mean/SD z when the robust (median
// +MAD) z is degenerate (MAD==0 on a tightly-clustered quantized baseline —
// whole-bpm RHR / integer skin-temp ADC), which was intermittently blanking the
// whole readiness score to "—" on nights that had valid sleep. Bump so days that
// were previously absent-for-that-reason recompute a real score.
// v44: two consistency fixes; neither changes a scalar that a previously
// FINALIZED day_result already had right, but both affect data availability/
// consistency going forward. (1) A day whose offloaded second-half compute
// (naps/workouts/HRR/wear/curves/wake-features) failed or timed out — but
// whose headline scalars (readiness/RHR/RMSSD) already succeeded — could get
// marked finalized and treated as fully "derived" by the raw-pruning guard,
// permanently losing the raw substrate needed to ever fill in those missing
// fields on retry. Now tracked via a new `partial` day_result column and
// excluded from both age-based finalization and the pruning guard until the
// second half actually completes. (2) The wake_day_features early-read
// artifact (what the Today repo shows before the full day result is ready)
// was copying the pre-hybrid-correction 1Hz-only step/calorie estimate
// instead of the corrected real-100Hz+1Hz hybrid value computed moments
// later in the same pass — the final day_result was always correct, only
// this transient early read was stale. Bump so any day currently sitting
// non-finalized re-derives with both fixes in effect.
// v45: cardioStager REM LF/HF hot-path fix. `_windowRemFeatures` fed ABSOLUTE
// epoch seconds (~1.75e9) into the per-30-s-epoch Lomb–Scargle, forcing every
// sin/cos onto libm's __kernel_rem_pio2 multi-precision slow path. Over a full
// night (~1000 epochs × 240 freqs × ~180 beats × 2 loops) that is tens of
// millions of slow-path trig calls — and because v42 runs staging on the MAIN
// isolate (for the ambient profile blend), it landed on the UI thread and
// produced recurring multi-second freezes → Android ANRs (Crashlytics 0.9.13:
// libm.so __kernel_rem_pio2 / sin / cos, "slow operations in main thread").
// Fix rebases beat times to the window start; L-S is time-shift invariant so
// LF/HF is unchanged in exact arithmetic (only last-ULP float differences, which
// is why a bump is warranted). Bump so non-finalized days re-stage on the fast
// path. Paired with this: `_sleepCandidateForDay` now runs the whole staging +
// profile-fold on a WORKER isolate (the analytics ambient profile globals are
// re-armed inside the `Isolate.run` closure and returned as plain JSON) instead
// of the main/UI thread — so the residual staging CPU no longer blocks the UI
// even before the ~10× trig win.
// v46: readiness-blank-"—" fix — `_seriesMean` trailing-28 window fix +
// analytics re-pin picking up the `robustZ`->`z` fallback (v43 above,
// analytics#26) so quantized baselines with MAD==0 stop intermittently
// blanking a legitimate score.
// v47: readiness's RHR input (`rhrToday` in onehz_pipeline.dart) no longer
// accepts the `rhr` metric's daytime-HR fallback — it now requires an actual
// detected sleep session (`hasSleep && sleepHr.isNotEmpty`), matching how
// HRV/resp/temp were already gated. Previously a no-sleep day could still
// produce a full numeric readiness score off RHR alone (a few minutes of live
// daytime HR masquerading as overnight resting HR), which is how a fresh
// install could show "Readiness 100" ~10 minutes after first wearing the
// strap. Also removed `getDayStress`'s `100 - readiness` fallback in
// local_repository_impl.dart — it fabricated a stress-looking number whenever
// the real Baevsky SI was absent, violating the never-impute rule; the UI
// already correctly renders "—" when `score` is null. Bump so affected days
// re-derive without a same-day, no-sleep readiness/stress score.
// v48: audit sweep across compute + the sibling analytics package.
//
// EDGE-LOCAL changes, which ship the moment this constant lands:
//   - The per-sweep baseline snapshot is genuinely frozen. `appendScalars` is
//     gone; the history is dated and loaded once, and `valuesBefore(key, date)`
//     excludes the target day from its own baseline. A re-derive sweep could
//     previously append each finished day back into the shared window and evict
//     a real old day, collapsing median/MAD toward duplicated recent values —
//     the same pollution shape edge#108 fixed on the load path.
//   - A day is no longer allowed to sit inside its own readiness baseline, and
//     lnRMSSD no longer double-appends today.
//   - `nocturnalRhr` is now fed the positionally-dense day series instead of a
//     compacted one, so its 30-minute window is real wall-clock again.
//   - Profile imputation (age 30 / 70 kg / sex m / RHR 60) no longer persists
//     strain, calories and zones as if they were measured.
//   - SRI no longer drops the one hypnogram segment per night that crosses
//     local midnight; CTL/ATL/TSB now sees a calendar-dense series so fitness
//     and fatigue decay across rest days.
//   - Historical days resolve their timezone offset at their own timestamp
//     rather than through today's offset.
//
// SIBLING-PACKAGE changes ride along with this bump: the analytics sweep from
// the same review (sleep no longer reporting a no-data window as light sleep,
// the Lipponen-Tarvainen threshold on the signed dRR series, abstention on
// degenerate dispersion, the reconciled TRIMP stack, circular social jetlag)
// and the protocol decode fixes. This was NOT true when v48 was first written —
// pubspec.yaml still pointed at the pre-fix SHAs then, and this note said so.
// The pins were moved as part of v49; see the pin-status note above it.
// v49: steps/activity rebuilt on a calibration-invariant feature.
//
// Diagnosed on a real user database: the day reported 39,384 steps against a
// true value of ~2,000. ENMO is `mean(max(0, |a| - gRef))` and gRef is
// auto-calibrated per day from the stillest samples — which are the long sleep
// block, where the wrist sits in a different orientation. gRef came out at
// 0.9797 that day vs ~1.032 on every other, and since ENMO subtracts it from
// every sample, a reference 0.05 g low adds 0.05 g to every minute: exactly the
// 0.05 g walking floor. Sweeping gRef over the identical samples gave 42,155
// steps at 0.97 and 0 at 1.02 — the signal and the calibration error are both
// ~0.05 g, so no threshold could have fixed it.
//
// The analytics package now decides activity from the per-axis high-passed
// dynamic amplitude (gravity is DC in the sensor frame; any per-axis offset or
// gain error cancels exactly), anchored on a PERSONAL floor pooled from
// trailing days rather than an absolute constant or a same-day baseline — both
// of which were measured to fail, in opposite directions.
//
// Edge side of that change:
//   - `dyn_p90` joins the baseline series: each day persists its own high
//     quantile of the dynamic amplitude, and the next day's derive takes the
//     MEDIAN across trailing days (self-excluded, like every other baseline) as
//     its floor. Below the minimum history the estimator ABSTAINS — a day with
//     no personal baseline now reports the real 100 Hz count only, instead of a
//     fabricated 1 Hz number.
//   - `active_min` is persisted as a first-class series. Minutes are what 1 Hz
//     can resolve; steps are derived from them as a range.
//   - The steps bundle carries the range + the floor used, and says plainly
//     when the 1 Hz estimate is absent.
//
// This bump also re-derives days whose stored step figure came from the old
// estimator.
//
// PIN STATUS: as of this bump pubspec.yaml points at the analytics and protocol
// PR-branch commits, so everything described in v48 AND v49 is genuinely in the
// build — the edge code physically cannot compile against the older analytics
// pin, which is how we know. Those pins must move to the merge commits (and
// this must bump again) when the sibling PRs land. Verify any analytics claim
// made here with `git show <pinned-sha>:<file>` before trusting it; a changelog
// citing a change the pinned SHA never contained is how v43 documented a
// readiness fix that stayed broken for three releases.

// v50: the sibling PRs merged; pubspec.yaml now pins the resulting `main`
// commits (analytics f5ccae6, protocol a98cd70) instead of the PR-branch heads
// v49 briefly pointed at.
//
// A version bump is required even though no edge SOURCE line changed with it.
// kAlgoVersion identifies the code that PRODUCED a day_result, and that code
// includes the pinned siblings: a device holding v49 rows built against the
// PR-branch SHAs must re-derive against the merged ones rather than serve them
// as equivalent. Treating "same content, different commit" as not worth a bump
// is the assumption that lets a stale bundle survive a dependency change.
//
// Verified at the merge commits themselves, not inferred from the PRs being
// green: steps.dart carries the new step API, rr_correction.dart has the
// signed-dRR `seg.add(x[k])`, advanced_stager.dart has maxAccelCarryForwardSec,
// live.dart has kKnownRecordVersions.

// v51: edge#170 — autoDetectWorkouts' motion-confirmation gate (tuned for
// arm-swing activities) silently dropped every low-limb-swing cardio window
// (cycling/rowing: the wrist stays still on a handlebar/oar) no matter how
// strong the HR signal was. analytics#32 (PR-branch head, pinned above —
// repin to main once merged) adds an HR-ONSET bypass: the gate is skipped
// only when mean bpm over the candidate's first 3 min rises >=25 bpm versus
// the 3 min immediately before it (Whipp & Wasserman 1972 phase-II kinetics),
// which fires on genuine exercise starts but NOT on slow-drifting elevations
// (fever/heat/anxiety) that have no discernible onset — so this changes which
// suggestions autoDetectWorkouts emits without loosening the false-positive
// gate it exists to protect.
// v52: the rolling per-user sleep profile (`sleep_user_profile`) was folded on
// EVERY staging pass for a day, not once per day — a real 12-day export carried
// `nights: 1348`. Two consequences, both bad: `personalWeight` pinned at its
// 0.5 cap from the first sweep, and an EWMA collapsed onto whichever day was
// re-derived last. Replaying that profile against the same 11 nights moved wake
// 4.3% -> 36.4% and deep 1.9% -> 0.0% on the worst night, i.e. the
// personalization layer was re-creating the wake over-call cardioStager exists
// to avoid. Fixed by (1) folding at most once per day_id (tracked in the
// profile payload), (2) withholding the profile from staging until
// kMinNightsForSleepProfile nights (van der Aar 2025: gains need >=3 nights and
// ~17.5% of subjects get WORSE from personalization), and (3) discarding
// pre-tracking profiles, which cannot be repaired, so they rebuild honestly.
// Bump so every day re-stages without the corrupt blend.
// v53: repin analytics to main @ #34 — the sleep-stager decision layer is
// rewritten. Deep and REM were boolean conjunctions AND-ing one informative
// axis with one null one (rmssd, Cohen's d -0.13 deep / -0.02 REM) and one
// INVERTED one (mean HR, d +0.31 for deep, i.e. deep sleep runs slightly
// FASTER than light on the wrist), so all three could only co-fire by
// coincidence — which is why deep sleep came out as isolated 30-second specks
// that the 3-min minimum-bout rule then deleted. Scored against 99 PSG-labelled
// wrist nights those rules managed kappa 0.036, with deep PPV 5.7% against a
// 4.5% base rate and REM 12.1% against 14.0% — at or below chance for both.
// Now weighted robust-z scores (weights = the measured effect sizes) over
// Rk / hrSd / sdnn / lfhf, with rmssd and mean HR dropped: kappa 0.128, 0.132
// on held-out subjects, deep 53.0/12.9 and REM 52.6/20.7 sens/PPV. Every day's
// hypnogram, stage minutes and sleep-derived scalars change, so every day must
// re-derive. Also picks up the protocol realtimeRr bound (live HRV no longer
// sees implausible sub-100ms "beats" from a misaligned 0x28 frame).
// v54: NOOP CSV imports now bank the export's `step_counter` as REAL steps.
// NOOP's schema gained a `steps` stream (and a `band_sleep_state` column that
// shifted event_kind/event_payload) — the importer read columns by name so it
// never misparsed, but it dropped `steps` into its default branch and every
// imported day reported steps = 0 while the band had actually counted them
// (2,572 over the 3.5 h in the OpenStrap/edge#160 export). The counter is now
// differenced into contiguous runs and written to `live_coverage`, the same
// table the live 100 Hz pedometer uses, so imported and live days count steps
// identically and the 1 Hz estimate still cannot double-count those minutes.
// Only the `steps`/`active_min` block of IMPORTED days changes; no live-sync
// output moves. NOTE this bump does not retro-fix an existing import — imported
// days are force-finalized snapshots with no stored raw to recompute from, so
// an already-imported day needs a re-import to pick its steps up.
// v55: NAPS. Daytime naps were "detected" by the NOCTURNAL detector, which
// rejects them on purpose — `AdvancedSleepStager.minSleepMin = 60` exists so
// "daytime naps and stray still-blocks stay excluded", and anything centred
// 11:00–20:00 local additionally needed ≥90 min plus an HR dip. So the 20–45
// min afternoon nap was STRUCTURALLY undetectable, and `detectNaps` advertised
// a 20-min floor it could never reach, returning an empty list with a
// reassuring (and false) "no qualifying naps (20 min–3 h)" note.
//
// SIBLING (analytics): new `sleep/nap.dart` — the only nap source. Enumerates
// every van Hees z-angle immobility bout on the complement of the main sleep
// window (an ANGLE, so it does not inherit the ~13% |accel| spread across
// static postures), requires an HR dip against the AWAKE-DAYTIME baseline
// rather than a night-dominated whole-day median, and reports TST and in-bed
// separately. No sleep-stage claim: a 30-min nap holds no complete cycle and
// the daytime HR duty cycle will not support a 4-class partition. The shared
// immobility primitive is factored out as `immobilityMask` so night and nap
// run one implementation. Specifics worth knowing:
//   - The awake baseline excludes the main sleep AND every detected bout. It
//     cannot include the candidate's own seconds or the hours of tonight's
//     sleep the nap window borrows, or the dip gate becomes self-suppressing —
//     the quieter the sleep, the lower the bar it must beat.
//   - Under 10 min of awake HR, the day is not judged at all. A median over a
//     handful of samples is not a baseline, and every verdict hangs off it.
//   - Durations are WALL CLOCK, not sample counts. The substrate is a
//     positional array with pruning/sync holes, so a run also breaks at a
//     timestamp discontinuity; otherwise an unobserved hour reads as unbroken
//     stillness and 20 min of evidence reports a 2 h nap.
//   - Deferral is CHAIN-aware. Deferring only the bout that touches the array
//     end is not enough: an ordinary 6-min awakening at 01:50 splits tonight's
//     sleep, and only the trailing half touches the end. Every bout chained to
//     an unfinished one (within napChainGapSec) is unfinished too.
// Verify the analytics pin actually contains this before shipping the bump
// (AGENTS §3.5).
//
// EDGE-LOCAL changes, which ship the moment this constant lands:
//   - `_sleepPeriods` no longer runs its OWN nap detector (20-min stillness
//     runs). That second notion disagreed with `detectNaps` on real days —
//     the committed `payload.json` shows a 21-minute period alongside
//     `naps.count: 0` — and fed a different screen. One source now (§3.8).
//   - Periods speak the contract the Sleep-periods screen actually reads
//     (`onset_ts`/`wake_ts`/`duration_min`/`efficiency`), which it never did:
//     every nap card rendered "0m" with a red confidence dot regardless of
//     what was detected. `duration_min` is minutes ASLEEP for both the main
//     sleep and naps, which were previously different units under one label.
//   - `nap_min` is TST, not the in-bed span. It is subtracted 1:1 from sleep
//     need, so crediting in-bed minutes over-credited every nap by its awake
//     time and always erred toward recommending LESS sleep.
//   - An unfinished bout is DEFERRED, not emitted (see the sibling notes). With
//     a 3 h post-midnight buffer the first hours of TONIGHT'S sleep were being
//     written as a multi-hour "nap" for the day that was ending, then counted
//     again as tomorrow's main sleep.
//   - The main sleep period's TST/efficiency are carried into the day-blocks
//     isolate. That isolate builds its own `scMap` seeded with `rhr` alone, so
//     reading `scMap['tst_min']` there yields null forever — which would have
//     made every main-sleep card read "—". Efficiency is normalized from the
//     stored percent to the 0..1 the card contract uses.
//   - `total_asleep_min` is null when any listed period's minutes are unknown.
//     Summing a null as 0 printed a confident total short by exactly the part
//     we could not measure, and the hero arc divides by it.
//   - `sleep_coach.nap_credit_min` is the credit ACTUALLY applied, not the raw
//     nap minutes: `sleepNeed` clamps to [6 h, 11 h] after subtracting, so a
//     large credit is only partly realized.
//   - Today-scoped reads require an explicit `is_today` stamp on the cross-day
//     record. Taking the last record positionally is yesterday on any day whose
//     row has not been derived yet.
//   - Off-wrist and charging spans are passed to the detector from the strap's
//     own WRIST_OFF/WRIST_ON and CHARGING_ON/OFF events. These were decoded
//     and persisted to `band_events` all along and never used; a band on a
//     table or charger is motionless and is the dominant nap false positive.
//   - Absent ≠ zero: when nap detection cannot judge a day, `nap_min` is left
//     UNWRITTEN, and the sleep-need credit reads TODAY only. It previously
//     fell back through `_lastNum` to YESTERDAY's nap minutes (§3.3).
//   - `sleep_coach.nap_credit_min` exposes the credit that was subtracted, so
//     the coach card can show it instead of silently shrinking the ring.
//
// Days re-derive so naps, nap_min, sleep_periods and sleep need are rebuilt.
// v56: the STRAIN half of the same today-scoping bug. v55 fixed `nap_min` but
// left `sleep_coach.need`'s other today-scoped input reading through
// `_lastNum`, so a day whose strain compute abstained built tonight's strain
// bonus out of an EARLIER day's workout — the identical §3.3 imputation, in the
// identical function, two lines apart. Measured on a 7-day fixture: a carried
// strain of 18 inflated `need_sec` by 2314 s (38.6 min) over a today-abstained
// day. Now `_todayNum`.
//
// Direction note, because it differs from v55 and the difference matters: naps
// are SUBTRACTED and strain is ADDED, so while both inputs floor at 0, that
// floor is an upper bound on need for naps and a LOWER bound for strain.
// Abstaining to 0 strain therefore recommends up to 45 min LESS sleep, not
// more. It is still correct — carrying yesterday forward is not a safety margin
// but noise around the true value (it inflates need only when yesterday
// happened to be harder than today), and strain is a same-day accumulating
// quantity that genuinely starts at 0 — but it is not the cautious direction.
// Because it is not, it is not allowed to be silent either:
//   - `sleep_coach.strain_bonus_min` reports the minutes the bonus ACTUALLY
//     added, measured like `nap_credit_min` (re-run with strain zeroed and
//     diff), so the [6 h, 11 h] clamp cannot make the card claim an increase
//     `need_sec` never took.
//   - It is NULL, never 0, when today produced no strain reading. A confident 0
//     says "you rested"; null says "we could not measure today's strain, so
//     tonight's need is short by up to 45 min". Collapsing those would re-hide
//     exactly what the today-scoping fix exposed.
//   - The Sleep Coach card renders the applied bonus as a "+Xm added for
//     today's strain" line (`strainBonusCaption`), mirroring the nap credit.
//     The card stays SILENT on null, matching the nap precedent — surfacing
//     "today's strain was not measured" to the user is a product decision, and
//     the bundle carries the distinction for whoever takes it.
//
// Days re-derive so sleep need, bedtime, wake and sleep performance are rebuilt.

// NOTE ON NUMBERING: v55 and v56 above are the nap/strain work (PR #204),
// which merged first. The three entries below are this branch's, renumbered
// from 55/56/57 to 57/58/59 so the constant stays STRICTLY MONOTONIC. That is
// load-bearing, not cosmetic: the derive gate matches algo_version EXACTLY
// while the read seam serves MAX(algo_version), so a version that goes
// backwards writes rows nobody reads and re-derives forever.
//
// v57: THE 1 Hz STEP ESTIMATE IS DELETED. Steps are now real-measured only.
//
// Diagnosis on a real user DB (2026-08-03): the app reported 2,645 steps for a
// day the user took under 400. It was 23 "active minutes" x an assumed 115 spm.
// Both halves of that conversion are invalid at 1 Hz, and neither is fixable by
// re-tuning:
//   * Cadence is NOT IDENTIFIABLE. Gait is 1.4-2.3 Hz (Straczkiewicz 2023,
//     doi:10.1038/s41746-022-00745-z); at 1 Hz every fundamental is sub-Nyquist
//     and 80/100/140/160 spm alias to the same 0.333 Hz. No published step
//     detector exists below 10 Hz.
//   * The minutes were never specifically ambulation. At the wrist, arm work
//     out-accelerates walking (stirring ~104 mg, chopping ~139 mg vs walking
//     ~66 mg ENMO), so a movement threshold cannot isolate gait even at full
//     rate: wrist devices emit 22-27 false steps/min during dishes, reaching
//     and driving (O'Connell 2017, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0169616) while
//     detecting slow walking at sensitivity 0.05. The two errors have OPPOSITE
//     sign, so no gain constant corrects both.
// Confirmed against this DB's own ground truth: the single window where the
// 100 Hz pedometer and 1 Hz overlap had HR 95->108 and dynAmp 0.31-0.40 g, and
// the REAL count was 11 steps in 3.1 min (3.5 spm) where the estimator would
// have assigned ~115 spm.
//
// What changes: `scalars.steps` is now ABSENT unless a gait-capable source
// measured the day (band 100 Hz, phone pedometer, or a NOOP import — all in
// `live_coverage`). Days with no such source lose their step number entirely
// rather than showing an invented one. `active_min` survives as an explicitly
// NON-locomotion movement-volume index (bundle key `movement`) and is no longer
// coverage-excluded, since there is no longer a step total it could double-count
// into. Steps also stopped being written to Apple Health / Health Connect, both
// because the old value was fabricated and because we now READ the phone's own
// pedometer from that store and must not feed our copy back to ourselves.
// Every day's steps/active_min move, so every day must re-derive.
// v58: movement minutes rebuilt on MEASURED evidence. Every change below was
// proven against 4 days of this user's real 1 Hz substrate before being made;
// two proposals were REFUTED by the same tests and deliberately NOT built.
//
//   * HR GATE DELETED. `restingHr + 8 bpm` changed active minutes by exactly
//     ZERO on every day tested. At RHR ~62 it sits at ~6% of heart-rate
//     reserve — below every ACSM band — and 73-100% of covered minutes already
//     cleared it. It also failed in the wrong direction: PPG HR is least
//     reliable during the motion being gated, so a dropout deleted minutes the
//     accelerometer measured fine. `dailyActiveMinutes` no longer accepts HR.
//   * x3 CEILING DELETED. It rejected ZERO minutes on all 4 days with
//     0.42-0.55 g of headroom, and cannot fire on artifacts (a 3 s knock
//     averages ~0.23 g, below the FLOOR). The only thing it could ever exclude
//     was a genuinely hard session.
//   * FLOOR IS NOW FROZEN after a 14-day enrollment, not recomputed daily. A
//     threshold derived from the signal it thresholds cancels the trend it
//     exists to report: scaling a real day's dynAmp gave 37 active minutes at
//     1x, 1.5x, 2x AND 3x activity when recomputed, versus 23 -> 254 frozen.
//     Re-freezes only on device/wrist change, a 30-day wear gap, or 365 days.
//   * NOT BUILT (proven unnecessary): accel autocalibration — offset and
//     uniform gain cancel exactly through the high-pass and the floor
//     normalisation (+5% gain moves the gate decision by 0.0000); only
//     anisotropic gain survives at ~1-3%. And gravity/forearm orientation —
//     it solved the ambulation problem v55 deleted. A sleep-anchored floor was
//     also tested and REFUTED: CV 138.6% across days vs 9.3%, and on one night
//     it landed above the entire day's range (would report zero).
//   * SEMANTICS CORRECTED. The R24 1 Hz accel field is a fused GRAVITY vector,
//     not acceleration: across 269,486 real samples ||a|| is p50 1.027 g with
//     0.030% above 1.3 g, and during the single most vigorous minute of a day
//     it was 1.033 g +- 0.006 (0 of 420 samples above 1.2 g). So `dynAmp`
//     measures how fast the wrist RE-ORIENTS, not how hard it accelerates, and
//     ENMO/MAD over this substrate are ~(1.03 - gRef): a pure calibration
//     artifact with zero signal. That is the true root cause of the original
//     42,155-steps-at-gRef-0.97 / 0-at-1.02 collapse.
// active_min moves on every day; steps are unaffected by this bump.
//
// v59 - review follow-up: the ABSENT `steps` block stops labelling itself. It
//   carried `tier: 'ESTIMATE'` alongside `value: null`, and `Metric.parse` maps
//   that tier to `beta: true`, so a day with no measurement at all rendered the
//   estimate badge. Absent now means absent: `tier: null` (parsing to
//   MetricTier.unknown) and an empty `inputs_used`. No VALUE changes, but the
//   persisted bundle does, so days derived at v58 must be re-derived to pick it
//   up. `ABSENT` was deliberately NOT invented as a fifth tier — `Tier.all` in
//   analytics is a closed set of four published grades.
//
// v60 - the all-day HRV and respiratory curves advance their cadence cursor on
//   every ATTEMPT rather than only on a successful estimate. `_dayRespCurve`
//   left `lastEmit` unset whenever rsaRespRate came back absent — and absent is
//   the EXPECTED daytime case, because daytime RSA is movement-confounded — so a
//   confounded stretch re-ran the triple Lomb-Scargle once per beat instead of
//   once per five minutes. That is what exhausted the 90 s day-blocks budget and
//   left days persisted headline-only. `_dayHrvCurve` had the same shape plus an
//   O(window) sum that ran before its cadence gate was checked. Both curves keep
//   their sampling intent; points that were previously emitted a beat or two
//   after a failed attempt now land on the next cadence tick instead.
// v61 - NAP EDITS. The nap detector's answer is now a PROPOSAL: a nap the user
//   logged is added, and one they rejected is suppressed, replayed over the
//   detector's output on every derivation rather than written into it (so a
//   better detector later still respects "there was no nap here"). Rejection
//   matches by OVERLAP, not by exact bounds, because the detector's boundaries
//   shift between runs and an edit that stopped applying when a boundary moved
//   by a minute would be worse than useless.
//
//   This moves numbers, which is why it is a version bump rather than a read
//   path: `nap_min` is summed over the merged list, so a logged nap credits
//   against sleep need and sleep debt exactly as a detected one does — that
//   was the explicit product decision, not an accident of where the code sat.
//   Days carrying an edit are force-derived alongside sleep-override days, so
//   an edit to an already-finalized day actually takes effect.
// v62 - ONE CALORIE PASS PER DAY, with the wake/whole-day split made explicit.
//   The day's energy figures were produced twice, by two different pieces of
//   code, and the two did not agree.
//
//   * `calories` was summed by a derivation-local copy of Keytel
//     (`_keytelCaloriesWake`) that billed the FULL Keytel rate on every active
//     minute, while `Calories.dailyEnergy`'s active component nets the basal
//     minute out because the total already counts it. The same minute was paid
//     for twice — `calories` high by basalPerMin x active-minutes, ~70 kcal on
//     a day with one hard hour, scaling with active time.
//   * `calories_total` was then OVERWRITTEN further down the day block by a
//     second `dailyEnergy` call with different gating and a different span (a
//     flat 1440 minutes of BMR rather than the minutes actually covered), so
//     the persisted pair came from two different estimates.
//   * Both propagated: the Health export writes BASAL_ENERGY_BURNED as
//     `calories_total - calories`, so the exported basal was wrong by tens of
//     kcal/day, in either direction.
//
//   Both scalars and the TDEE bundle block now come from ONE `wakeDayEnergy`
//   pass, published in one place, so `total - active == basal` holds by
//   construction. The local Keytel copy is deleted and the duplicate
//   `dailyEnergy` is gone.
//
//   THE SPLIT, stated once so it stops drifting. `calories` is ACTIVE energy
//   over the WAKE span. `calories_total` is TDEE: Mifflin BMR pro-rated over
//   the minutes of the calendar day the substrate actually covers — sleep
//   included, because basal metabolism does not stop overnight — plus that same
//   active surplus. Feeding the whole-day series to the active term bills sleep
//   as exercise: `dailyEnergy`'s HR-flex gate is 0.50 x Tanaka HRmax, i.e.
//   104 - 0.35*age bpm, only 79.5 bpm at age 70, so an older sleeper's ordinary
//   nocturnal heart rate clears it for the whole night. `onehz_pipeline`'s
//   early-read `calories` is the same active-over-wake quantity off the same
//   series; `wakeDayEnergy` is canonical and the pipeline mirrors it.
//
//   SAME BUMP, second change: the day's calories now require a real HEIGHT and
//   go absent without one. `dailyEnergy` defines active as the SURPLUS over the
//   Mifflin basal minute, so the Mifflin height term sits inside the active
//   figure as well as the total — standing 170 cm in for an unknown height
//   moves both. On a 35 y / 80 kg male with 600 wake minutes at 130 bpm, 150 cm
//   against 195 cm is active 6500 vs 6383 and total 8068 vs 8232 kcal. Those
//   are persisted scalars and they are exported to Apple Health / Health
//   Connect, so the stand-in writes a body the user does not have into their
//   health record. An absent input makes the dependent metric absent. A
//   height-less profile that used to get an active figure now gets none until
//   height is filled in; nothing else about the day changes.
//
//   SAME BUMP, third change: TRIMP's sex constant read `sex == 'f'` while the
//   calorie path beside it accepted 'female' too, so a profile written by the
//   profile screen (whose options are male/female/other) scored female calories
//   and MALE strain off one field. Both now go through `workoutSex`. This moves
//   strain, not just calories, for anyone stored as 'female'.
//
//   There is no fitness model here and no sleep gate on the calorie path. An
//   earlier cut of this change fed a resting-HR-derived VO2max into Keytel's
//   fitness-adjusted variant, gated on the day having produced a sleep-derived
//   resting HR. Both are gone: the estimator's error exceeds the spread of the
//   quantity it estimates, and running it made a trait metric move by tens of
//   kcal/day on ordinary night-to-night resting-HR noise. The published
//   age/mass/sex model is the only one used.
//
//   Each of these moves numbers on a derived day, hence the bump; finalized
//   days recompute onto the corrected figures.
//
//   The SESSION paths changed alongside them and carry no algo version of their
//   own, which is NOT the same as being recomputed on read. `stopWorkout`
//   writes the live figure into `sessions.calories`, and the substrate re-score
//   only replaces it when the band handed over at least 90% of the window; a
//   session whose stream came back sparse keeps the live number permanently.
//   That number changed here: the tick used to bill a bare Keytel rate every
//   second the band reported a heart rate, with no activity gate and no resting
//   floor, and now bills through the same per-sample gate, resting floor and
//   gap cap as the re-score. Already-stored sessions are left alone — they are
//   not re-derived — so the change applies from this version forward.
// v63 - RR BEATS ARE FETCHED BY rec_ts, NOT BY COUNTER SPAN.
//   The derivation pages 1 Hz frames ordered by rec_ts and then pulled that
//   page's RR beats with `decodedRrByCounterRange(first.counter, last.counter)`.
//   The strap's counter resets on every reboot, so the moment a page straddled
//   one the span was inverted or nonsensical and the query returned nothing:
//   the page decoded with an EMPTY beat list, and every beat-derived figure for
//   that stretch — RMSSD, SDNN, the HRV curve, and the readiness that leans on
//   them — silently came back absent or computed off whatever beats survived on
//   the other pages. Both tables are keyed by rec_ts now, so the lookup uses the
//   page's own rec_ts bounds and pulls exactly its beats.
//
//   Days already finalized at v62 hold those RR-less results permanently — they
//   are never revisited at the same version — so this needs the bump to be
//   re-derived onto real beats.
// v64 - THREE CHANGES TO WHAT REACHES THE 1 Hz SUBSTRATE.
//   1. R-R beats are no longer read for record versions whose field map is
//      unconfirmed. v7 carries hr at offset 27 and v18 at 14, so those layouts
//      are demonstrably not v24's, yet the beats were being read off v24's map
//      and the 200..2500 ms filter passed enough of them to hand RMSSD a full
//      set of invented intervals. RMSSD/SDNN/HRV move for any day built from
//      those versions.
//   2. A record only decodes if its packet type says it is one. The dispatch
//      keyed on inner[1], which is the version on a data frame but the sequence
//      byte on a control frame, so roughly 2 in 256 control frames decoded as a
//      trusted record — hr and an accel vector read out of log text. The
//      substrate re-decodes stored hex, so any such row is gone now.
//   3. Gen4 v25 records stay archived instead of being banked. They carry a
//      timestamp and a gravity vector and no heart rate at all, and hr is NOT
//      NULL with 0 meaning off-skin — so banking them would have asserted the
//      band was off the wrist for every one of those seconds.
//
//   day_result is keyed (day_id, algo_version), so days finalized at v63 keep
//   results built on the old substrate unless the version moves.
//
//   NOT in this bump, though both were candidates: the accel-coverage gate and
//   the R10-lite exclusion both landed at v63 already. Check the pinned SHA
//   before citing a sibling-package change here — a bump whose stated cause is
//   not in the pinned code is how a fix was believed shipped for three releases
//   while the pin never carried it.
//
// v65: THE 0–21 HEADLINE STRAIN SCALE IS RECALIBRATED.
//
//   `strainScore` was `min(21, ln(TRIMP+1)/ln(1.5))` over whole-waking-day
//   Banister TRIMP. Two things were wrong with that, and they compounded:
//
//     * Whole-day TRIMP counts every waking minute above resting, so ~16 h of
//       ordinary living accrues ~180 TRIMP before any exercise. Log base 1.5 is
//       steepest near zero, so that overhead alone bought ~13 of the 21 points:
//       on a real bundle an INACTIVE full-wear day scored 12.8.
//     * Each further point cost 1.5x the load, so 21 sat at TRIMP ~4987 —
//       roughly 35 h at 80 % HRR. The top third of the scale was unreachable;
//       a marathon read ~15.8. The whole usable range was about 8 to 16.
//
//   Strain is now the load earned ABOVE a quiet-waking baseline (20 % of HRR,
//   scaled by the wake window actually observed, so partial wear is not charged
//   a full day's overhead), mapped by 21·ln(1+u·14)/ln(15) with u = net/400.
//   Anchored on real days: inactive ~0, rest + a walk 2-4, a 45-min moderate
//   run 8-11, a 90-min hard session 14-17, 5 h at 160 bpm 21.
//
//   SAME BUMP: `strainTarget`'s recovery bands are rebased onto that
//   distribution (they asked for "recover 4-8" on a scale whose floor was 13),
//   and its fatigue/freshness tests are now ratios against CTL — they compared
//   raw TRIMP in the hundreds against thresholds of 10 and 5, sized for the
//   0-21 scale, so they fired on ordinary week-to-week noise. The intraday
//   `strain_curve` also picks up Banister's 0.64/0.86 scale coefficient, which
//   it had been dropping entirely (it accumulated a TRIMP 1.5625x the day's).
//
//   Days inside the raw-retention window re-derive from substrate on this bump.
//   Older days have no raw to re-derive from, so `strain_backfill.dart` rebuilds
//   their headline from the stored TRIMP + wake window instead — see that file
//   for why that is exact and what it deliberately drops.
// v66: THREE analytics outputs change shape or value.
//
//   1. CIRCADIAN, newly computed. `circadianNonparametric` (IS/IV/RA/L5/M10,
//      van Someren 1999) and `cosinor` (Halberg/Nelson 1979) were written,
//      tested and never called from edge. They now run in the cross-day rollup
//      over a new per-day field, `hourly_hr` — 24 local-hour HR means projected
//      from the stored `series.hr_curve`. HR, not accelerometry, because the
//      1 Hz substrate is pruned at 3 days and `day_result` is not: no multi-day
//      accel exists to analyse. Only runs of calendar-CONSECUTIVE days whose 24
//      bins are ALL covered are admitted (no imputation — a filled hour is
//      exactly the smooth signal IS rewards), and each family abstains with the
//      standard `need_baseline:have=H,need=N` note below its own minimum (7 days
//      nonparametric, 3 cosinor). New bundle keys: `circadian_rhythm`,
//      `circadian_cosinor`, `circadian_coverage`.
//
//   2. STEPS on gen5. `stepMotionCounter` was decoded, stored in
//      `decoded_onehz.step_count` and read back, but `Substrate` had no field
//      for it, so derivation never saw it and a WHOOP 5 user with a real wrist
//      pedometer got no steps unless they enabled the phone one. The channel is
//      now carried end to end; the counter is cumulative u16, so the day's total
//      is the sum of PLAUSIBLE positive deltas — a wrap is recovered modulo
//      65536, a reset fails the plausibility budget and contributes nothing.
//      The band counter outranks `live_coverage`; both are disclosed. Gen4 has
//      no such counter and is unaffected (its every second reads ABSENT, not 0).
//
//   3. SLEEP CYCLES gain their Metric envelope. `sleep.cycles_metric` is
//      `sleepCyclesMetric` over the same detection the raw `cycle_count` /
//      `cycles_mean_min` keys already carried, so tier and confidence are read
//      rather than asserted by the UI. The raw keys are unchanged.
//
//   ALSO on this bump: `crossDayArtifactUsableToday` now checks the
//   `algo_version` it has always stamped. It did not, so a bump that changes the
//   per-day row SHAPE (as this one does, adding `hourly_hr`) would have been
//   served the pre-bump artifact for the rest of that day.
// v67: ABSENCE STOPS READING AS A MEASUREMENT. Schema v39 makes the six sensor
//   columns of `decoded_onehz` nullable, so a record that carried no accel /
//   no optical / no thermal reading is no longer written as a real zero, and the
//   readers that consumed those zeros now see absence.
//
//   1. ACCEL. `(0, 0, 0)` has a z-angle of exactly 0.0° and an ENMO of 1.0 —
//      i.e. absent accel read as a PERFECTLY STILL wrist to active minutes, the
//      activity curve, restlessness, the sleep restlessness map and ENMO, and
//      as a motionless wrist to auto-workout detection (a missed workout).
//      `Substrate.accelPresentAt` existed and had exactly one consumer, the van
//      Hees coverage gate; every other feed now consults it too, and
//      `accelSamples()` marks absent seconds `valid: false` (which `enmoSeries`
//      and `positionSeries` already honour). Active minutes, the activity curve
//      and restlessness are now fractions over OBSERVED seconds, not over all
//      seconds — a day with accel gaps moves.
//
//   2. HEART RATE gains a physiological bound at the substrate. The gen4
//      TRUSTED decode path (v24/v12) returned the HR byte verbatim, so one
//      corrupt-but-CRC-valid byte of 250 passed the `hr > 0` filter and became
//      the day's max HR. Out-of-range now reads as the existing "no usable HR
//      this second" 0 — never clamped into the range, which would invent a
//      plausible reading. Applied here rather than in the decoder because
//      rejecting there costs the whole record, accel and RR with it.
//
//   3. `fit_quality` / `fit_warning` are GONE. They scored band tightness from
//      `skinContact`, which is not a contact measurement (it is the sign+
//      exponent half of a float32) and was a hardcoded 0 on the decoded path.
//
//   4. CPC IS WITHDRAWN, not absent. `cpc_ratio` is gone from the bundle and
//      from `metric_series`: its "respiration surrogate" was the NN series
//      itself, so the number was the RR periodogram HF/LF ratio under another
//      name (measured agreement 1.0000085). It never measured cardiopulmonary
//      coupling; it needs a real respiration channel to come back.
//
//   5. FROM ANALYTICS (verify the pinned SHA carries these before shipping —
//      the v43 lesson): `lf_hf`/`lf`/`hf`/`total` are now physical PSD in
//      ms²/Hz rather than dimensionless (0.095 → 2.20 on a synthetic) and are
//      Welch-averaged over band-appropriate segments; `ulf` is absent rather
//      than 0.0; sleep staging, the illness CUSUM and the anomaly detector all
//      moved (a real night went wake 17.5 → 26.0 min, TST 516.5 → 508.0); and
//      `round6` returns null on a non-finite input instead of passing a NaN on.
//
//   6. THREE substituted inputs stop being substituted. `hrRecovery` now gets
//      `tsSec`, so "+60 s" is clock time rather than +60 ARRAY POSITIONS on a
//      gappy tail (it overstated the drop, read as a fitness marker);
//      `enmoSeries` gets `expectedMinutes: 1440`, so coverage is not 1.0 for a
//      day worn 4 h out of 24; and the sleep coach no longer substitutes a
//      population 8 h for a missing personal OSD — need, bedtime, wake and
//      sleep performance are ABSENT until an OSD estimate exists.
//
//   ALSO on this bump: the cross-day rollup artifact is stamped with
//   `algo_version` / `built_for_day` / `built_at_epoch` so the reader can fail
//   closed instead of serving a previous version's VO₂max, fitness age, sleep
//   need, strain target and illness flags; and its encode is sanitised, because
//   ONE non-finite double used to make `jsonEncode` throw and drop the ENTIRE
//   bundle (see `sanitizeForJson`).
//
// v68 — ONE bump for the whole sweep (compute + analytics). Everything below is
// recomputed by the same derive pass this constant gates, so it is deliberately
// a single increment rather than one per fix:
//
//   1. STRAIN STOPS BEING BUILT ON A DAYTIME "RESTING" HR. The offloaded second
//      half took its TRIMP reference from `scalars.rhr`, which back then fell
//      back to daytime HR for the general resting-HR card (it no longer does),
//      and then overwrote `scalars.strain` with the result — so a day where the
//      pure pipeline abstained (`clinical.strain` "—") still published a
//      number, off an awake reference ~20 bpm high. It now reads the
//      nocturnal-only `scalars.rhr_nocturnal` (the same value readiness uses),
//      and when neither that nor a user-entered resting HR exists, strain is
//      ABSENT: the scalar is written NULL (overwriting any stale value) and
//      `clinical.strain` is stamped absent with it. Affected days lose or lower
//      their strain — that is the fix, not a regression.
//
//   2. `hrv_timeline`'s `t` is EPOCH SECONDS. It was seconds-since-the-first-NN
//      (`correctRr` re-bases its clock to 0) on a view whose contract — and the
//      coach's prompt — say epoch, so coach SQL over it returned 1970 and no
//      join to `hr_curve` could ever match. Its first point also now requires a
//      full 5-min window instead of being an RMSSD over 10 beats (~8 s) drawn
//      on the same line as the real windows.
//
//   3. `strain_effort`, `spo2` and `odi_per_hour` are gone from `metric_series`
//      (and from the coach's advertised keys). Nothing has ever produced them:
//      12 rows, 0 values, on every install. A metric this app does not produce
//      has no entry and no key.
//
//   4. The one-shot strain rescale prices the quiet-waking baseline over the
//      window the pipeline actually used (`series.strain_curve`, one point per
//      wake minute) instead of `worn_min − tst_min`, which was off by −15..+22
//      min on every real day measured. Days that cannot supply it now abstain.
//
//   5. Personal baselines withhold z/delta/ratio/in_normal_range until at least
//      one real night has been folded (analytics no longer seeds a baseline at
//      the midpoint of the metric's physiological bounds), and the resting-HR
//      percentile-of-you is oriented lower-is-better.
//
//   6. FROM ANALYTICS on this bump: `correctRr` advances its clock by the REAL
//      interval on a spline-corrected beat (it was dropping ~1 s of record per
//      correction, inflating cvhr per-hour and shortening hrvFreq's span).
//
// v69 — the sweep bump, and the repin that should have come with v67. The pins
// sat on analytics cef6fe4 / protocol 3ea0290 while every local run built the
// sibling working copies through pubspec_overrides.yaml, so v67 and v68 both
// cite analytics behaviour no shipped build ever had. pubspec.yaml now pins
// analytics beaeafa and protocol e33e53a, and those SHAs are repeated below as
// kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin so a future repin cannot skip this constant.
//
// What moves on a re-derive:
//
//   1. ACTIVE MINUTES are the z-angle wake quantity, always — never ENMO. Days
//      derived after the movement floor froze change value, which is the point.
//      With no usable accel (or under 60 samples) `active_min`, `activity.value`
//      and the restlessness block are NULL rather than 0: a day nobody wore the
//      band was reporting a measured zero.
//
//   2. THE IRREGULAR-RHYTHM SCREEN is analytics' shared one, not edge's second
//      copy. Differences are taken only between beats adjacent in the INPUT (a
//      dropped artifact run was manufacturing one huge spurious difference), it
//      needs 500 beats rather than 20, it is ABSENT instead of publishing
//      sd2 = 0 with "regular" on a degenerate series, the flag now also wants
//      pNN70 >= 30%, and confidence scales with beat count and artifact
//      fraction instead of sitting at a hardcoded 0.5. `flag` can be null.
//
//   3. SLEEP SEGMENTATION uses the habitual-midsleep prior, which was written
//      and never called. Anyone with 14+ stored nights whose midsleep is far
//      from 03:30 can see a different sleep block picked on nights with
//      competing candidates — so TST, staging, nocturnal RHR/RMSSD and
//      readiness all move with it. Biggest behavioural change in the batch.
//
//   4. SKIN TEMP EXISTS ON GEN5. `skin_temp_adc`, `skin_temp_z` and readiness's
//      temp driver were permanently absent there. Units stay relative either
//      way (gen4 ADC, gen5 centi-°C) and are only ever read as a z against the
//      user's own baseline — but a history that crosses a gen4 -> gen5 swap
//      takes one baseline step while the z re-settles.
//
//   5. FROM ANALYTICS (beaeafa, and this time the pin carries them): personal
//      baselines withhold z/delta/ratio/in_normal_range until a real night is
//      folded instead of seeding at the midpoint of the physiological bounds;
//      resting-HR percentile-of-you is lower-is-better; the circadian
//      non-parametrics (m10/l5/relative amplitude and their onsets) are OMITTED
//      when any hour of day was unobserved rather than filled with the grand
//      mean and 0.0; readiness_composite drops the `meaningful` key and the
//      SWC-gated tail on its note; chronotype's absent-note text changed.
//
//   6. FROM PROTOCOL (e33e53a): a gen4 band on a record version whose field map
//      we never confirmed (v7/v9/v18, unknown) reports spo2/skin-temp/ppg/
//      ambient ABSENT instead of bytes read off a guess — relative ODI and the
//      ADC-derived wellness inputs go from a number to honest absence on those
//      bands. v24/v12 are untouched. A gen5 v18 record with an out-of-range HR
//      byte now decodes (hr absent, beats/temp/steps kept) instead of landing
//      in raw_archive, so gen5 gains decoded_onehz rows it never had.
//
//   ALSO: `crossday.recent[]` carries an `unsettled` bool, `hrv_timeline` keeps
//   the v68 epoch fix, and the strain/energy paths are unchanged.
// v70 — the device seam. Which band measured a day is now an INPUT to the
// numbers derived from it, and a day that cannot say which band that was gets
// no number instead of gen4's. Pins move to analytics 98d42b6; protocol stays
// at e33e53a, unchanged and sealed.
//
// READ THIS FIRST — WHAT WILL LOOK LIKE A REGRESSION AND IS NOT:
//
//   `decoded_onehz.device_family` arrived at schema 41. It is NULL on every row
//   written before that, on every import and on every raw replay — which is all
//   of today's data. So on a re-derive of any EXISTING day, everything
//   downstream of the HR ceiling goes ABSENT: strain, TRIMP, the day's HR
//   zones, wake-day calories, and every session's zone_bands/zone_min. That is
//   the contract working, not a break. We do not know what measured those
//   seconds, so we cannot say where their ceiling is, and gen4's number is not
//   a default for a strap we did not identify. Days recorded from here on carry
//   the family and keep their numbers. Already-banked session strain/kcal/zone
//   splits are NOT destroyed — reconcile keeps the stored value; it is the
//   re-score and the on-read recompute that abstain.
//
// What moves on a re-derive:
//
//   1. ONE HR CEILING, DEVICE-DISPATCHED. There were five: `220 − age` in
//      local_repository_impl, app_state and analytics' load_trimp; Tanaka
//      `208 − 0.7·age` inlined in onehz_pipeline and crossday_pipeline; and
//      `(220 − age) + 25` in hr_max. A session stored its zone_min against one
//      and its detail screen recomputed zone_bands against the other, for the
//      same session, with nothing on screen saying so. Everything routes
//      through `estimatedMaxHr(age, family)` now. At 30 the ceiling goes
//      190 → 187 and at 60 160 → 166, so BAND MEMBERSHIP CHANGES: 150 bpm at
//      age 30 was Z3 and is now Z4. `hrCeilingForAge` is deliberately NOT
//      folded in — it is an artefact-plausibility bound with headroom, and
//      clipping it to the training ceiling would eat real effort.
//
//   2. Both families carry Tanaka today, and they are listed SEPARATELY on
//      purpose. The ceiling a strap's zones sit on is a property of what that
//      strap can measure at intensity, so the day gen5 earns its own number it
//      changes one entry in hr_max.dart rather than everyone's.
//
//   3. TWO NEW `metric_series` KEYS: `midsleep_sec` and `sleep_onset_sec` —
//      signed seconds either side of 04:00 LOCAL, tz-corrected per instant and
//      unwrapped. Not a second-of-day, not an epoch. FORWARD-ONLY: midsleep was
//      never persisted, the 1 Hz substrate they come from is pruned at 3 days
//      and a day locks ~48 h after wake, so no past night can be given one.
//
//   4. `day_result` stamps `source: 'band'`. An importer's day is a different
//      vendor's derived score and must carry its own tag; a day whose
//      provenance is genuinely unknown stays NULL and is never retro-filled.
//
//   5. `decoded_onehz.hr` stores NULL where it stored 0 — off-skin is absence,
//      not a heartbeat. No number the app produces changes (every reader
//      already gated `hr > 0`), but a new query must not assume NOT NULL.
//
//   6. FROM ANALYTICS (98d42b6, the device-seam commit — and only that):
//      * `device.dart`: `calibrationFor()` returning null for an unstamped
//        strap, or for one this metric has no numbers for, rather than handing
//        back gen4's constants. This is what (1) dispatches on. No registry, no
//        shared constants file and no closed list of families — a metric
//        declares its own String-keyed map next to itself and refuses when the
//        stamp is not a key in it.
//      * journal correlations ran 9 numeric fields against 4 outcomes behind a
//        per-test gate. That is 36 simultaneous tests, so ~2 spurious
//        "meaningful" findings per user were guaranteed by construction.
//        Benjamini-Hochberg over the grid now, so FINDINGS DISAPPEAR and an
//        empty result is a real answer the card has to be able to say.
//      * habits are custom fields with max == 1, so a 0/1 variable was getting
//        a Spearman rho and a Theil-Sen "slope per unit". They route to
//        difference-of-means.
//      * `hrRecovery` publishes a fitted tau off a 180 s tail with a residual
//        gate, alongside hrr-60 rather than replacing it. It abstains often —
//        the recovery is biphasic and one exponential conflates the phases.
//      * the weekday effect is Kruskal-Wallis first, then a permutation test on
//        the max deviation, so the 7-way selection is paid for. Without that it
//        is a machine for manufacturing superstitions about Saturdays.
//      * sleep runs terminate at unobserved instead of merging across it.
//      * the apnea screen returns the per-cycle depths and widths it was
//        already accumulating and throwing away.
//      * `vo2maxEstimate` and `physiologicalAge` are GONE: 15.3·maxHr/rhr is
//        k/rhr, a restatement of a line already on screen, and the age function
//        then counted rhr twice in the same direction. Edge stopped calling
//        both before this pin, so nothing on screen loses a value.
//
//   7. FROM PROTOCOL: nothing. e33e53a is unchanged and sealed.
//
//   NOT IN THIS PIN, SO NOT AT THIS VERSION: the rest of this wave's analytics
//   work is UNCOMMITTED in the sibling working copy — the journal lag
//   realignment, SRI's `pairs`, the sleep stage ranges, `stageIntervals`,
//   `cvhrPersonalDistribution`, `alertnessForecast`, `sessionHrCeiling`,
//   `tempCircadian`'s family dispatch. Local runs see them through
//   pubspec_overrides.yaml; a clean checkout does not, and edge lib/ already
//   calls nine of those symbols. Commit analytics and repin at the NEXT
//   version — this is exactly the v67/v68 failure, one commit from repeating.
//
//   ALSO, not a re-derive: schema 43 (`source` on decoded_onehz/decoded_rr,
//   `external_hr`, `imported_measurement`, `sessions.cadence_spm`,
//   `sessions.rpe`) and `Substrate.hrValid` (gen5-only, no consumer yet).
//
// v71 — the algorithms audit. No new feature in here. Every item is a number we
// could not stand behind, either corrected or withdrawn. Pins do not move:
// analytics stays 391ede4, protocol stays e33e53a, sealed and unread.
//
// READ THIS FIRST — THE PIN DOES NOT CARRY THE FIXES BELOW, YET.
//
//   Every analytics change in this block is UNCOMMITTED in the sibling working
//   copy. 391ede4 is analytics HEAD and predates all of it. So a local build
//   (pubspec_overrides.yaml) derives a day at v71 with these numbers and a
//   clean checkout derives the SAME day at v71 with v70's — the collision this
//   constant exists to prevent, and the v67/v68 failure with the sides swapped.
//   Do not cut a build off this pin. Commit analytics, repin, and bump again in
//   the same change; then this block is true. Until then v71 is local-only.
//   Both sibling branches are also UNPUSHED (analytics
//   `fix/numerical-correctness`, protocol `fix/gen5-bounds-and-write-guard`),
//   so these SHAs resolve on this machine and nowhere else.
//
// WHAT DROPS OR GOES ABSENT — the part that reads like a regression:
//
//   1. ACTIVE ENERGY FALLS, HARD. `dailyEnergy` bills only the minutes actually
//      above the flex-HR gate. Measured through the real code on the real DBs:
//      gen4 median daily ACTIVE 1,955 -> 48 kcal, total 1,544-5,582 -> 793-3,437
//      kcal/day; MG active 539 -> 9, 3,042 -> 680, 695 -> 0. A quiet day now
//      reads essentially basal, because that is what it was. This is the number
//      people eat against, and the Apple Health / Health Connect ACTIVE_ENERGY
//      export moves with it. Already-derived days keep the old inflated figure
//      until re-derived. Strain, TRIMP, steps and active minutes are unchanged.
//
//   2. NIGHTLY RMSSD REFUSES ON A JITTERY NIGHT. The lag-1 autocorrelation of
//      the NN difference series (`diff_acf1`, new key on every night) separates
//      real beat-to-beat variability from per-second beat quantisation. Both
//      WHOOP 5 nights in the corpus refuse — so readiness on a W5 runs on its
//      other three drivers — MG drops 87.7/82.9/76.9 -> 58.0/52.7/48.0 ms, and
//      gen4 comes down 2-13%. `rmssd_ms`/`pnn50_pct` are absent on all five
//      gen5/MG nights and none of the thirteen gen4 ones; `rmssd_nocturnal` is
//      absent on gen5/MG and 0.1-1.8 ms lower on gen4. `confidence` moved on
//      every night, 0.95 -> 0.30..0.82 — the old value was a constant wearing a
//      measurement's clothes. Refusal note prefix `rmssd_refused:acf1=`.
//      Everyone's `ln_rmssd` history is now on a slightly different scale than
//      the days before it: the trailing baseline re-converges, the transition
//      day reads off. Deliberately NOT a device-family gate — MG and W5 are the
//      same family and land on opposite sides of it, so the night's own signal
//      is the better judge and an unknown strap gets judged on its data.
//
//   3. READINESS REFUSES ON A COLD START. Under 2 surviving inputs, or under
//      0.5 of the weight, the composite is '—' rather than a score built out of
//      one driver and a shrug. Two of seventeen real gen4 days go: 2026-08-03
//      (was 44.7) and 08-07 (was 0.8). Note prefix `need_inputs:`.
//
//   4. THE TEMP DRIVER REFUSES UNTIL WE MEASURE A SETTLED FRACTION. A nightly
//      skin-temp mean over a window that includes warm-up and off-wrist is not
//      a nightly skin temp. Nothing supplies a settled fraction yet (see
//      BLOCKED), so the driver is refused everywhere and readiness runs on
//      three drivers: 7 of 17 gen4 days shift, all within 2.1 points except
//      08-14 at -7.6. THE CHANNEL IS UNTOUCHED — `skin_temp_raw` ingest,
//      `skinTempAdc`, `skinTempZ`, `skinTempCoverage`, `tempIllnessFlag`,
//      `menstrualCoverline`, `tempCircadian` all still exist and still publish.
//      What is gated is one nightly mean's fitness to be used, and the band is
//      one-sided on purpose so a fever is never trimmed.
//
// BASELINES, AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING GATED ON A Z:
//
//   5. `Baselines.update` — the engine under recovery, illness and stress.
//      Measured on real gen4 nights: resting_hr spread +11.0%, hrv spread
//      +5.6%, |z| down 11.5% and 5.6%. Every z threshold in the stack shifts
//      with it. `nightsSinceUpdate` now also increments on a hard-outlier
//      night, so fourteen consecutive rejected nights correctly read `stale`
//      instead of `trusted`.
//
//   6. SLEEP CONFIDENCE moves on 3 of 8 real gen4 nights, largest 0.440 ->
//      0.600. It scales `stageIntervals` half-widths and stamps three sleep
//      Metrics, so the stage ranges on screen widen or narrow with it.
//
// THINGS THAT COULD NEVER FIRE, AND NOW CAN:
//
//   7. `glassBoxReadiness` published an empty `drivers` list and "nothing moved
//      beyond your normal day-to-day noise" on essentially every night. Both
//      populate now. The `past_mdc` JSON key is unchanged on the wire but means
//      "outside your usual spread" (SWC), which is what the detail screen's
//      copy already said.
//
//   8. `overreachingConjunction` was structurally unable to fire.
//      `nights_elevated` can be non-zero and `both_point_same_way` true.
//
//   9. Cross-day circadian: `circadian_rhythm`, `circadian_cosinor` and
//      `circadian_coverage` go from permanently absent to populated.
//
// THINGS THAT DISAPPEAR:
//
//  10. JOURNAL INSIGHTS GET MUCH STRICTER — permutation p, Benjamini-Hochberg q
//      over the whole grid. A small journal now produces zero insight rows
//      where it produced several, and zero is the honest answer the card has to
//      be able to say. New optional `p`/`q`; thin rows come back
//      `insufficient` with `need_history:have=N,need=M`, which nothing reads
//      yet and should be surfaced.
//
//  11. `alertnessForecast` changes shape, LENGTH (the curve now ends with the
//      waking day, so it varies with sleep duration), trough window and note.
//      Any golden over that curve moves.
//
//  12. Withdrawn keys and wrong attributions: `prsa` loses `risk_tier` (no
//      readers), `segmentChangePoints` says GREEDY / Killick 2012 and doubles
//      its default penalty (no production callers), `sleepDebt` loses a
//      citation it never implemented.
//
//  13. `multivariateAnomaly`'s default gate is 1.25x-13.23x wider under 90
//      nights of baseline. Zero flags before and zero after on the real corpus,
//      so nothing on screen changes today — it removes ~4%/night of false-flag
//      exposure during a new user's first month.
//
// BLOCKED ON EDGE WIRING — INERT AT THIS VERSION, EACH ONE LINE, EACH ITS OWN
// BUMP WHEN IT LANDS:
//
//   * `onehz_pipeline.dart:296/:388` — `correctRr(d.sleepRrMs)` /
//     `correctRr(d.dayRrMs)` want `rrTsMs: d.sleepRrTsMs` / `d.dayRrTsMs`. The
//     default path is byte-identical, so nothing moves until they are passed.
//     The moment they are: the analysed span goes from 0.13-0.87 of the window
//     to 0.99-1.00, LF/HF moves on 12 of 13 nights and CROSSES 1.0 — the line
//     people read as sympathetic-vs-vagal — on three (MG 08-12 0.65 -> 1.53,
//     W5 08-11 0.72 -> 1.25, gen4 08-09 0.88 -> 1.01), VLF by up to 33x, and
//     rsaRespRate stops publishing 9.00 br/min on gen4.
//   * `onehz_pipeline.dart:329` — `hrvTime(nn, nnTimesMs: nnTimes)` wants
//     `artifactFraction: artifactFraction`, already in scope twelve lines above
//     where `hrvFreq` gets it. Worth 13.7-15.3% of confidence on the MG nights
//     and 1.8-5.1% on gen4; until then half of item 2's confidence fix is dead.
//   * `derivation_engine.dart:4010` — `ana.cusumChangePoints(rhrSeries, h: 5.0)`
//     wants `dates: rhrDates`, built four lines above it. Until then the
//     critical-priority "Your resting heart-rate trend shifted" notification
//     still accumulates evidence straight across a wear gap.
//   * Nothing measures a settled fraction, so `nightlySkinTemp` is unwired and
//     item 4 fails closed everywhere. When it lands, nightly skin temp becomes
//     the mean of the settled portion rather than of the window: +0.2 to +6.0
//     counts on real gen4 nights, and the stored `skin_temp_adc` history is
//     old-rule until a recompute regenerates it.
//
// RULINGS, unchanged and re-checked: protocol sealed, not read, not edited.
// The gen4 skin-temp channel stays. SpO2 still refuses on every day of every
// DB. `_crossDayWindow` is still 90. Water is still a reminder.
//
// STALE IN THIS FILE, not fixed here because it is another owner's diff: the
// comments at :4377, :4425, :5023 and the header block at :637-666 all still
// quote the old 0.50*HRmax flex gate that item 1 moved.
//
// v74: WEAR COVERAGE divided by the wrong thing, and a charging caveat.
//
//   1. `coverage_pct` was `wornSec / (last sample - first sample)` — the span
//      of the DATA, not the day. A band worn 9-11am and nowhere else reported
//      100%, and `day_strain` renders that number as the sentence "The band saw
//      N% of this day". The denominator is now the OBSERVABLE day: local
//      midnight → min(data edge, next local midnight), both bounds from the day
//      LABEL so the two DST days are 23 h/25 h rather than a hardcoded 86400.
//      A day still in progress divides by the part of it that has elapsed, so a
//      fully-worn morning still reads 100% instead of "60% missing" for hours
//      that have not happened. Every finalized day re-derives onto a LOWER
//      number wherever the band came off before the last record of the day —
//      on a partly-worn day this is the whole point, and it is the first time
//      that sentence has been true. Nothing else consumed the field: three
//      screens read it (day_strain, investigate, health_screen) and all three
//      already handle null.
//   2. `wear.segments` followed the same span, so the hole between midnight and
//      the first record was invisible — which would now contradict the
//      percentage beside it. Leading and trailing off-segments are emitted, and
//      `sum(on)/observable == coverage_pct` exactly. `longest_off_min` can grow
//      on a day that started late; that is the measurement, not a regression.
//   3. Charging INSIDE the scored sleep window is flagged (`sleep_charging`),
//      after being scored, staged and fed into baselines unremarked on 2 of 9
//      real nights. A battery-pack swap is not a wrist-off event — the strap
//      stays on the wrist and keeps logging, so no wear signal can see it. NO
//      confidence penalty: see `sleepChargingBlock` for the mechanism argument. The
//      charging/wrist-off span read also widened back to sleep ONSET, which is
//      before local midnight on any normal night, so a pre-bed top-up that
//      opened and closed before the day's first record is no longer missed.
//   4. Comment-only: the daytime-stress refusal at `_daytimeHrv` claimed gen5's
//      `signalQualityLogVariance` is "dropped before the DB". Since schema 43
//      it is written to `decoded_onehz.signal_quality_logvar`. Still unread, and
//      deliberately so — it is gen5/MG-only, so gating on it makes the same
//      night answer differently on two straps. The refusal's construct argument
//      is untouched and is the one that carries it.
// v75 — THE ISSUE AUDIT. Every issue and discussion ever filed was re-checked
// against the shipped tree; these are the ones that were still true. Four
// numbers move, and each moved because it was wrong, not because it was tuned:
//   1. READINESS carries its fourth driver. `tempInput` refused on every night
//      ever shipped, because `settledFraction` was never passed from this side
//      — the driver was documented, weighted 0.10, and unreachable. The other
//      three renormalised over 0.90 and quietly absorbed it. Nights the strap
//      cannot vouch for (device_family NULL, pre-schema-41, imports, gen5) are
//      refused BY NAME now instead of silently.
//   2. READINESS BANDS are the score's own quantiles. The composite is a
//      logistic with no scale parameter, so its centre is 50 — and 50 was
//      labelled "Take it easy". Half of every user's nights read as a warning
//      by construction, and "Good to go" needed every input ~1.4 SD above
//      personal median at once. The score did not change; the verdict did.
//   3. PEAK HR stopped contradicting itself. The workout producers smoothed
//      through hr_max.dart, the day peak still did reduce(math.max) over raw
//      1 Hz — so the strain card and the timeline printed different numbers off
//      the same beats (#127, closed once already). Manual saves and the
//      below-coverage reconcile fed it unsmoothed too.
//   4. CALORIES and STRAIN follow the analytics gates above, and both abstain
//      rather than guess: a day with no resting HR now has no calorie figure
//      instead of billing every waking minute as active.
// Also here, changing nothing derived: a night never re-stages shorter than the
// one already banked (#242 — the guard only fired on a FAILED pass and never
// compared tst_sec, which is why a fixed night came back wrong a few syncs
// later), and absent accel stays absent instead of coalescing to zero.
// v76 — IMPORTED DAYS WERE SETTING THE BASELINE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO STAY OUT
// OF. The rule that a vendor export never feeds a personal baseline was enforced
// on the WRITE path only — three call sites check `isMeasuredDay`, while
// `_BaselineHistoryCache.load()` read `metric_series` with no source filter at
// all. Both importers write real series rows through `putDayResult`, so four of
// the eight baselines (`rhr`, `rmssd`, `readiness`, `resp_rate`) were being set
// partly by somebody else's algorithm. The other four escaped by accident, not
// design — the importers happen to write `skin_temp_z` rather than
// `skin_temp_adc`.
//
// NOOP is NOT foreign, which is the part worth remembering: `NoopIngest` holds a
// DerivationEngine and feeds it reconstructed 1 Hz substrate, so those days are
// our own maths and are stamped `source: 'band'`. Only `whoop_export` and
// `cloud_v2` are somebody else's.
//
// `source` is NULL for every day written before schema 43 and the backfill
// deliberately never fills it, so filtering on `source = 'band'` would have
// deleted genuine early history — a pollution bug traded for a data-loss one.
// It is decidable anyway: both importers put `imported: true` in the day
// bundle, which is what the write path has always tested. `importedDates()` is
// the union of both eras and the seam everything else reads through.
//
// Readiness, the illness CUSUM, and the training-zone and live-strain RHR
// anchors all move for anyone with an import in range. For a user who never
// imported this is a strict no-op: the set is empty and every read is unchanged.
// Days already finalized keep the score they were derived with — raw is pruned,
// so no bump can heal them.
// v77 — WALKING FINALLY PRICES INTO ACTIVE ENERGY (issue: "Walking calories
// are not counted"). MOT-02's HR-flex gate deliberately bills nothing below
// the ACSM moderate floor — right for HR (Keytel has no fitted data there),
// but it left a one-hour walk at 95 bpm adding ZERO active kcal while its
// steps counted fine. MT-05 established the 1 Hz accel cannot fill that gap;
// measured CADENCE can. `Calories.dailyEnergy` (analytics, CADENCE-Adults:
// 100/110/120/130 spm ↔ 3/4/5/6 METs) now prices sub-gate minutes whose
// measured cadence clears the study's own moderate floor, at (MET−1)
// basal-minutes of surplus. Edge feeds it the day's resolved `live_coverage`
// spans through ONE mapping (`cadenceSpmForMinutes`) from BOTH energy passes
// — the coordinator's canonical `wakeDayEnergy` and the pipeline's early-read
// mirror — so the two bill a walk identically. A minute the HR gate accepts
// still bills by HR alone (never both), an unmeasured minute stays basal, and
// a day with no pedometer coverage is byte-identical to v76. The TDEE block
// discloses the term (`live_coverage_pedometer` in inputs_used + the walking
// kcal in the note) only on days it actually priced something. Landed on
// main via edge#283/analytics#52 before this branch's own v78/v79 below;
// nothing here changes it.
//
// v78 — BAND-AGNOSTIC GROUPS A AND C (renumbered from this branch's own v77
// during the merge with #283 above — main had already claimed 77 for the
// walking term by the time this landed, and two different output changes
// cannot share one kAlgoVersion). The 1 Hz assumption comes out of the
// metrics that were counting array positions and calling them seconds, and four
// gen4 defects found on the way out. Eight entries move a published number:
//   1. A1 — BEAT TIMES REACH THE READ PATH. `decoded_rr.beat_ts_ms` (the
//      record's own sub-second anchor) was written and never SELECTed, so every
//      beat sat on a whole-second staircase and no dropout under 1 s was
//      visible. LF/HF and `span_sec` move with the re-anchored axis.
//
//      MAGNITUDE, CORRECTED 2026-08-23 against the owner's own gen5 export.
//      The +0.031% first recorded here was a LOWER BOUND — it came from a
//      measurement that forced `tsSubsec = 0`, isolating the staircase→chain
//      term and none of the real sub-second effect. On 2026-08-22: RMSSD
//      78.571 → 73.198 (−6.84%), pNN50 −0.56%, SDNN −1.36%, and n_beats
//      31177 → 30948 (−0.73%). 2026-08-23 moved the other way (+0.02%), so it
//      is per-night, not a constant shift.
//
//      SDNN and the beat COUNT both move, which the original note said they
//      would not. Not a defect: `beat_ts_ms` anchors a record's LAST beat and
//      walks backwards through the durations, so a 4-beat record's first beat
//      lands ~1444 ms BEFORE its own `rec_ts` (measured, and it scales one RR
//      per beat exactly as that model predicts). `_beatTimes`' dropout test is
//      `(rrTsMs[i] - rrTsMs[i-1]) - rrMs[i] > 1000`; on the staircase two beats
//      inside one record differed by 0 ms so it could NEVER fire. Sub-second
//      dropouts were structurally invisible. They fire now, the re-anchor set
//      changes, and `hrv_time`'s contiguous-pair mask changes with it — the
//      interval VALUES are untouched.
//
//      0.41% of beats (624/151,595, worst −1490 ms) step backwards where two
//      records overlap. Handled, not a hazard: `cur = (dropout && anchored >
//      cur) ? anchored : cur + rrMs[i]` never takes a backwards jump. `rr_ts_ms`
//      measured 0.00% non-monotonic only because a whole-second staircase is
//      trivially so — it hid the overlap rather than preventing it.
//
//      UNVALIDATED IN MAGNITUDE. Nothing available says whether 73.198 or
//      78.571 is closer to truth: the band's `hr` comes from the same beat
//      detector as `rr_ms`, so it is not independent evidence. That is the
//      simultaneous-H10 experiment, and this is its second reason to happen.
//   2. A2 — ACCEL VALIDITY SURVIVES SEGMENTATION. `AccelSample.valid` was
//      dropped converting to the segmenter's own type, so a night the strap
//      never vouched for was staged as if it had. Measured: 8 h of
//      `valid:false` published `TST 28619s, efficiency 100.0%`; it is absent
//      now.
//   3. A3 — BEATS WITH NO FRAME ARE KEPT. RR was looked up only inside the
//      frames loop, so a beat whose second has no `decoded_onehz` row was
//      discarded — and gen4's hr-only historical R10-lite produces exactly
//      those. The 1 Hz substrate is the UNION of frame and beat seconds now.
//   4. A4 — READINESS NEEDS 14 NIGHTS, not 3. A 3-night baseline is three
//      numbers: its MAD is routinely one quantum wide or zero, which is how a
//      degenerate z reached the logistic and the ring flashed a rail. Sub-
//      quantum spreads are refused outright rather than z-scored.
//   5. C1 — THE 30-MINUTE TROUGH IS 30 MINUTES. `nocturnalRhr` walks a wall
//      clock (`onehz_pipeline.dart`, `tsSec: sleepTs`) instead of counting 1800
//      positions. At a perfectly dense 1 Hz the two coincide; on real nights
//      they do not, because real nights have holes. Measured over this owner's
//      export: 2026-08-13 and 2026-08-14 are bit-identical (1 and 243 missing
//      seconds), 2026-08-12 moves 62.952 → 62.857 bpm (506 missing seconds of
//      25,262 — the positional window was averaging over ~30.5 min of clock and
//      missing the real trough). The wall-clock answer is the correct one, and
//      the same edit is what lets the metric exist at all at 60 s and 300 s,
//      where it previously abstained. It feeds readiness's 0.30-weight driver.
//   6. C9 — no metric credits a sample whose cadence cannot be measured. One
//      `sampleCadenceSeconds` with an ABSTENTION replaces three median-interval
//      helpers with numeric fallbacks; a band slower than 300 s used to have
//      every reading credited as one second (~300x zone undercount) and now has
//      no zone figure at all.
//   7. C13 — an unstamped substrate carrying a step counter reports
//      `band_measured: null`. Without a device stamp there is no modulus to
//      unwrap it with, and a guessed one publishes a step count at tier HIGH.
//   8. THE SAME TREATMENT FOR R-R AND FOR GRAVITY, which the list above missed
//      on the way past and which move published numbers exactly as items 1-7
//      do. `kMinPlausibleHr`/`kMaxPlausibleHr` had a sibling added either side
//      of it in `substrate.dart` and both are new here:
//        * `kMinPlausibleRrMs..kMaxPlausibleRrMs` (250..2400). Only `rr <= 0`
//          was dropped before, so a corrupt-but-CRC-valid interval reached
//          RMSSD, pNNx and every frequency-domain read. It drops the BEAT, not
//          the record — the surviving beats keep the placement `beatTimesMs`
//          already gave them.
//        * `kMaxSustainedAccelG` (4.0). `accelPresentAt` rejected only an exact
//          `(0,0,0)` fill; a second-long mean above 4 g is not a wrist either,
//          and it is now absent rather than present. That reaches every accel
//          consumer — van Hees, ENMO, movement minutes, the sleep segmenter —
//          because absent accel is NOT stillness.
//      Both refuse rather than clamp, for the reason `plausibleHrOrNull` does.
// v79 — REVIEW PASS ON v78 (renumbered along with it, see v78's note above).
// One edge fix and four analytics fixes, all in the same "a rejected reading
// must not still move a kept one" family v78 was itself about.
//   1. `beatTimesMs` (`substrate.dart`) let an interval `plausibleRrOrNull`
//      would go on to REJECT (positive but outside 250..2400 ms) still walk
//      every EARLIER beat in the record back by it, before the caller ever
//      saw the rejection. The interval that placed beat i-1 now has to pass
//      the same plausibility test placing beat i's own reading already does
//      — an implausible one breaks the chain (null, same as non-positive)
//      instead of silently displacing a beat that is kept.
//   2. `nocturnalRhr` (analytics) could reach a window with zero on-skin
//      samples and land `sum / count` as NaN, which then LATCHES as the
//      night's best trough (`m < best` is false for a NaN on either side) —
//      a present metric with a NaN value. Only reachable with
//      `minCoverage: 0`, which no call site in this repo passes; the fix is
//      defensive, no WHOOP output moves.
//   3. `_rescaleCounts` (analytics sleep stager) multiplied an
//      already-cadence-invariant gravity-delta sum by the cadence a second
//      time — the sum is already `epochSec * rate` independent of sample
//      count, so the extra factor inflated a slower-than-1Hz band's
//      Cole-Kripke score up to 5x. `cadenceSec == 1` at 1 Hz makes the factor
//      a no-op, so no WHOOP output moves.
//   4. `cardio_stager`'s epoch grid could silently drift from its own
//      reported `epochSec` whenever the measured cadence did not divide it
//      evenly — it abstains on that mismatch now rather than publish a grid
//      whose real spacing does not match its own label. WHOOP's 1 Hz cadence
//      always divides the 30 s epoch evenly, so no WHOOP output moves.
//   5. Readiness's sub-quantum-dispersion guard (analytics, following A4
//      above) only ran when `robustZ` came back null, missing a baseline
//      with nonzero MAD but still-quantized SD (whole-bpm RHR alternating
//      58/59: MAD 0.5, SD ~0.52, both below the 1-bpm quantum). Runs for
//      every quantized input now. THIS ONE CAN MOVE A WHOOP READINESS SCORE
//      — a baseline that happens to sit in that MAD-nonzero/SD-sub-quantum
//      gap now refuses by name instead of contributing a z-score built on
//      quantization noise.
// Days already finalized keep the score they were derived with — raw prunes at
// `rawRetentionDays`, so no bump can heal them.
//
// v80 — irregular-rhythm 24/7 SCREEN false-positive fix. `irregularBeatScreen`
// (analytics) computed one Poincaré SD1/SD2 + pNN70 ratio blended across an
// entire calendar day (sleep + rest + exercise + posture changes). Real user
// data showed EVERY sampled day sat at or over both thresholds (sd1/sd2
// 0.63-0.81 vs 0.70 cutoff; pnn70 27-56% vs 30% cutoff) — the "medical"
// notification was firing almost daily, because ordinary daily physiological
// variability alone clears these thresholds when blended into one number; the
// thresholds were never validated for a 24h aggregate (traced to an
// uncalibrated commit, PR #12). Fix: the screen now also requires the same
// two conditions hold independently in a real fraction (default 50%) of
// short (5-min) mostly-stationary windows across the day — i.e. sustained,
// not just present once in the blend. Wired at both call sites
// (`onehz_pipeline.dart`'s day-span AND sleep-only screens) via the new
// `nnTimesMs` param. THIS CAN MOVE `irregular_rhythm_flag` from 1→0 on days
// that were false-flagging; it cannot move it 0→1 (strictly stricter).
// PIN GATE (invariant #5): do not release with a pubspec pin that predates
// the analytics commit landing `_sustainedAcrossWindows` in
// irregular_rhythm.dart, or recomputing v80 against a sibling without it
// would silently keep firing the false positive.
//
// PIN GATE (invariant #5): v77 above cites the analytics walking term
// (OpenStrap/analytics#52). Do not release with a pubspec pin that predates
// that merge — recomputing v77+ against a sibling that cannot price walking
// would burn the version on nothing.
//
// v81 — ACTIVE ENERGY WORKOUT-GAP CREDIT. `applyDayActivity`'s calorie figure
// is built entirely from `daySub.hr` (the day's own continuous 1 Hz trace)
// and never read `sessions` at all — so a workout that scored its own
// calories through the SEPARATE session pipeline (`computeManualSessionStats`
// / the live-tick accumulator) contributed nothing to Active Energy whenever
// the band lost PPG contact for its whole window, which is common for a
// wrist-gripping or arm-swinging session (lifting, a brisk walk) next to a
// low-motion one (Pilates) that keeps contact. `applyDayActivity` now takes
// this day's `sessions` rows and credits a DONE, non-private session's own
// `calories` into the day total ONLY when `daySub` has ZERO real HR samples
// across that session's whole window — never a partial one, so a window the
// trace already priced is never double-billed. THIS CAN RAISE `calories` /
// `calories_total` for a day with a workout the day trace fully missed;
// every other day is unaffected.
// v82 — THE ZONE CEILING IS `max(observed, age estimate)`.
// `trainingZones` (compute/hr_max.dart) preferred `observedCeilingBpm` whenever
// one existed, in either direction. But that number is one-sided evidence:
// holding 195 proves the ceiling is at least 195, while holding 166 cannot tell
// "never went maximal" from "maxes at 166" — and on a wrist the first is far
// commoner. So a 25-year-old whose hardest HELD effort was 166 was banded at
// Z5 = 0.9·166 ≈ 149 bpm and banked 13 of the 16 minutes of a steady run in
// "Max effort". On the session-detail path the ceiling is even set by the
// session being graded — `_zoneAnchors` takes the all-time max including today
// (the day pipeline and the live tick do NOT: `observedHrCeilingBpm` is
// strictly-before, and `LiveWorkoutState.zoneSet` is pinned at start).
//
// The observed ceiling now anchors zones only when it REACHES the age line,
// which is the only direction in which it bounds anything. Below it, zones stay
// on `208 − 0.7·age`, LABELLED as the estimate. There is deliberately no
// tolerance band: a switch at `estimate − k` would move every edge k bpm on a
// 0.1 bpm change in a ceiling that creeps up over months, while `max` is
// continuous. `observed`/`karvonen` therefore now mean "this user beat the
// population line", which is a narrower and truer claim than before.
//
// WHAT ACTUALLY MOVES, for affected users only — narrower than it first looks,
// and the two exceptions are both worth knowing:
//
//   * `zone_timeline` and `zone_source` move: both come off the pure pipeline's
//     `trainingZones` set (onehz_pipeline.dart:630).
//   * The day's `zones` DO NOT, because they never sat on the observed ceiling
//     in the first place. The second derivation half recomputes them from
//     `estimatedMaxHr` alone (`_wakeZoneMinutes` at :4662, `zonesFromMaxHr` at
//     :4680) and `bundle['zones'] = wake['zones']` at :4920 overwrites the
//     pipeline's. So the day BARS have always been Tanaka-binned while the
//     footnote beside them read `zone_source`. That is a separate, pre-existing
//     one-source-per-concern break (§3.8) and it is NOT fixed here; fixing it
//     means threading the anchors through `_DayBlocksInput` across the isolate
//     boundary, which moves `zones` for every user and is its own change.
//   * Sessions rebin only where they still can. `getWorkout` recomputes
//     `zone_bands` on every open, from the substrate or the frozen trace, so
//     the DETAIL card is always current. The persisted `zone_min` behind the
//     bars is rewritten by `rescoreRecentSessions(sinceDays: 3)` and by the
//     rescore on open — but a session whose raw aged out past
//     `rawRetentionDays` keeps the split it was scored with. Old cards are not
//     healed by this bump, and no bump can heal them.
//
// TS-05's 28-day distribution disappears for anyone it was drawn for off a
// below-line ceiling, which is that gate working: `zonesAreMeasured` was never
// true of bands whose 100 % nobody reached. Strain, TRIMP and calories DO NOT
// MOVE — they anchor on `estimatedMaxHr`, never on the observed ceiling.
//
// `hr_ceiling_bpm` itself is untouched: the ceiling and its date are still
// measured, still stored and still served, so the zones screen keeps saying
// "highest we have seen: 166 on 3 Aug". It just no longer becomes everyone's
// 100 %. No sibling pin moves — this is entirely an edge-side anchor choice.
//
// RENUMBERED ON THE MERGE, 81 → 82. Both sides of this merge bumped to 81:
// main for the active-energy workout-gap credit above, this branch for the
// zone anchor. Two different derivations cannot share one number — that is
// the whole contract of this constant, and main's 81 is the one already on
// main, so it keeps it. Nothing about the zone change itself moved.
//
// 82 → 83 (edge#305): a re-derive at the retention-cutoff edge could produce
// null rhr/rmssd/readiness for a day whose sleep-window substrate had aged
// out while daytime HR survived, and — because `metric_series` is unversioned
// — silently clobber a good historical baseline point, collapsing the
// readiness baseline out from under later nights. That re-derive is now
// declined (see the guard in `_derivePreparedDay` right after `producedNothing`)
// so the older, complete row keeps being served. Also: the readiness z-cap
// abstention now populates `readiness_absent_diag` with its own
// `unstable_baseline:` reason instead of leaving it null (onehz_pipeline.dart).
//
// v83's guard was `hasSleepWindow && sleepSubEmpty && nightScalarsNull`
// (:4204) — #305's own writeup named this exact shape ("a sleep-window
// boundary check") as insufficient, with a counterexample: a day whose stager
// found NO window at all (`hasSleepWindow` false) still hit the original
// clobber, unprotected. The v83 fix also declined by early `return` rather
// than writing a protected row state, which is the OTHER approach #305 names
// and rejects ("wedges the pruner... retried every pass forever") —
// mitigated only by the pre-existing generic `_maxRawHoldDays` bound (14
// days), not by anything added for #305. v83 did ship #305's third proposed
// fix in full (the dedicated `unstable_baseline:` diagnostic).
//
// 83 → 84: repins both siblings to their main #-audit merges. protocol
// 6664854 -> 471034c (#42, live-decode-path fixes only — no persisted
// decoder moves, see the protocol pin comment). analytics 187e026 -> 1fa8144
// (#59): `sessionHrCeiling`'s corroboration window no longer lets a single
// un-averaged sample count as sustained motion (was reachable at the very
// first trailing-window iteration), and `irregularBeatScreen`'s
// sustained-window check no longer diffs across a beat that artifact
// rejection removed as if it were adjacent. Both feed stored scalars
// (`hr_ceiling_bpm` via `sessionHrCeiling` at :7662; the 24 h and sleep
// irregular-rhythm screens via `irregularBeatScreen` in onehz_pipeline.dart),
// so this bump is real, not a repin-only formality.
//
// 84 → 85 (edge#305, closing the gap left by v83): `nightSubstrateRegressed`
// no longer requires THIS pass to have found a sleep window (:4232). The
// counterexample v83 missed — a re-stage whose RR/HR substrate aged out and
// came back `NO_SLEEP_DETECTED` instead of a truncated window — is now
// declined the same way as the truncated-window case. Safety against
// clobbering a genuinely-honest "no sleep that night" derive still comes from
// the caller's existingHadNight check, not from this shape test: a day that
// never had real sleep never had an existing result with real night scalars
// to protect. #305 is now fully closed.
//
// 85 → 86 (analytics#40, closing edge#204's workaround): `_attachNaps`'s
// midnight dedup used to guess a bout was already-counted from
// `nap.startSec == 0`, which only ever matched the FIRST bout of the day's
// window — a fragment chained onto it by a brief arousal (`napChainGapSec`)
// has `startSec > 0` but is just as edge-anchored, and slipped through
// uncounted, double-crediting its minutes to both days. Analytics now
// propagates a real `NapWindow.startsAtRecordEdge` flag through the whole
// chain (nap.dart); `_attachNaps` tests that flag directly instead of
// re-deriving it from the index. Real output change (nap minutes / sleep
// need on days with a midnight-arousal-split nap), so the bump is real.
//
// 86 → 87 (M5, edge-only — no sibling repin): the multi-device coverage
// resolver lands. Three real output changes, all gated on more than one
// device actually having contributed to a day (a single-device install's
// `day_result.payload_json` is byte-identical — see coverage_resolver.dart
// §2 and test/multidevice_coverage_derive_test.dart's identity-case
// assertion):
//   1. THE SUBSTRATE ROW FILTER. `_loadSubstrateRange`'s page loop now
//      admits a `decoded_onehz`/`decoded_rr` row only when its `device_id`
//      matches the resolved span owner for its second, once more than one
//      device has real coverage. Before this, two devices' rows for the
//      same second both entered the substrate and the union/dedup logic in
//      `addDecodedPage` kept whichever page happened to arrive first —
//      order-dependent, not owner-decided.
//   2. PER-OWNER wristOff/charging MASKING. A window owned by device A is
//      masked by device A's own off-body/charging events only; before this,
//      one unfiltered query over the whole nap/sleep window meant band B on
//      the charger could exclude band A's real worn night.
//   3. `series.coverage` is written into the bundle (omitted entirely, not
//      `{}`, on any day with one contributor) — the per-signal span
//      attribution a future device-aware UI reads (M6).
// Do NOT read this as citing an analytics change: the baseline-dispersion-
// below-quantum guard (readiness_composite.dart) some earlier draft of this
// bump would have named is ALREADY IN the pinned SHA below — citing it here
// would repeat the v43 mistake (a changelog naming a change the pin already
// had) in exactly the shape that kept "readiness —" live for three releases.
// kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin are UNCHANGED: M5 touches no analytics or
// protocol code.
// v88 — THE BEAT AXIS IS HELD NON-DECREASING (`monotonizeBeatAxis`,
// substrate.dart). `beat_ts_ms` is a modelled beat position walked backwards
// from the record's sub-second anchor, so two records whose anchors sit closer
// than one beat place N+1's first beat before N's last. Measured on a live
// install: 94 inversions across 39,066 beats in a single day.
//
// Analytics binary-searches that axis and asserts it ascends. The assert is
// compiled out in RELEASE — so shipped builds did not throw, they mis-selected
// each 300 s window's beats, and every affected day was banked at v87 from a
// window gather that had silently skipped or duplicated beats. Those results
// cannot be told apart from good ones after the fact, which is exactly what a
// version bump is for: the days re-derive instead of being served from cache
// (`finalizedDayIds` / `sleepSessionCandidate` both key on kAlgoVersion).
//
// Real output change on affected days — window membership moves by up to the
// inversion depth (672 ms measured) — so the bump is real. Interval VALUES and
// their order are untouched by the repair; only the modelled clock moves.
// kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin are UNCHANGED: the repair is entirely edge-side.
//
// 88 → 89 (movement-floor DST fix): `daysSinceFrozen` (movement_floor_policy.dart)
// used to run `.difference().inDays` on the parsed LOCAL `DateTime`s directly.
// A span crossing a spring-forward transition loses that day's missing hour,
// so a real 10-day gap floored to 9 — the same trap `dayLabelBefore` above is
// built to avoid, just missed here. Now both dates are normalized to UTC
// midnight before diffing. Changes the movement-floor staleness/re-freeze
// decision (and therefore `active_min`) for any day whose gap from the
// frozen-on date spans a DST transition. Real output change, so the bump is
// real. kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin are UNCHANGED: edge-only fix.
//
// 89 → 90 (skin_temp_z quantum guard): onehz_pipeline.dart's `skinTempZ` was
// gated only on `sd > 0` against the raw-ADC baseline history, with no floor
// for the ADC channel's own quantization step. analytics already guards this
// exact channel (`tempInput(..., quantum: 1)` in readiness_composite.dart),
// refusing when the baseline SD sits below 1 ADC count even though a nonzero
// SD passed the naive check. `skinTempZ` now requires `sd >= 1` too, so a
// baseline oscillating between two adjacent ADC counts abstains instead of
// reporting an inflated z. Feeds `tempIllnessFlag`/`multivariateAnomaly` and
// the raw health_screen display value (readiness's own temp driver already
// went through the guarded `tempInput` path and is unaffected). Real output
// change on the affected sub-quantum-dispersion nights, so the bump is real.
// kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin are UNCHANGED: edge-only fix.
//
// 91 → 92 (baevskyStressIndex is now gap-aware): passes `nnTimesMs` at the
// one call site (onehz_pipeline.dart) so a charging/off-wrist hole inside a
// sleep window segments the 256-beat sliding window instead of one window
// straddling the gap and reading the pre/post-gap RR jump as MxDMn — the
// same bug class `cvhrApneaScreen` already had a fix for. Real output change
// for any night that had an internal gap. kAnalyticsPin bumped alongside
// this (analytics PR #70).
//
// 90 → 91 (`_resolveOwnership` drops newly-paired devices): once a signal's
// `signal_priority` had ANY stored row, a device that started declaring that
// signal afterward (paired later, no stored row) was never added to the
// candidate list `resolveOwnership` reads — its real `device_coverage` was
// silently excluded from ownership resolution forever. Now any coverage-only
// device is unioned in below the stored ranking (sorted, in-memory only,
// never persisted — same property as the empty-priority fallback). Real
// output change for any user who customized priority for a signal and then
// paired another device that also declares it. kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin
// UNCHANGED: edge-only fix.
//
// 92 → 93 (HRV frequency-domain Welch gap guard, analytics PR #72): the
// Welch segmenter in hrv_freq.dart only rejected a segment by beat count,
// never by time-completeness, so a mid-window gap (BLE reconnect, off-wrist
// moment) could still publish a bogus LF/HF/VLF/ULF/lf_hf/nu_lf/nu_hf/total
// reading at Tier.high. Now gated on both an endpoint-span check and a
// largest-single-gap check. Real output change for any night with an
// internal HRV-frequency-window gap. kAnalyticsPin bumped alongside this.
// Verified: `git show 82857106e41c346b4edf9ad617829a5ddd1cc5c1:lib/src/onehz/clinical/hrv_freq.dart |
//   grep -n 'segSec \* 0.8\|segSec \* 0.2'`
//
// 93 → 94 (`overreachingConjunction` rhr quantum guard, analytics PR #73):
// an alternating whole-bpm rhr baseline (58/59) has a small nonzero MAD that
// is unresolvable rounding noise, not real dispersion — the guard
// `dispersionBelowQuantum` already applies on this same rhr channel in
// illness_cusum/readiness_composite/event_detection. Without it, a 1bpm rise
// could clear the gate and fire the "both facts point the same way" card on
// nothing. kAnalyticsPin repinned to analytics PR #73's merged main SHA.
//
// 94 → 95 (`glassBoxReadiness` rhr/temp quantum guard, analytics PR #75):
// same gap as #73, but on the stored "readiness_glassbox" narrative/drivers
// key crossday_pipeline still writes — glassBoxReadiness never gated its
// 0.5*scale rhr/temp standardization with dispersionBelowQuantum, so a
// quantized baseline (e.g. alternating 58/59 bpm) could get named a driver
// off rounding noise. edge's `_glassInput` calls now pass `quantum: 1` on
// both channels. kAnalyticsPin repinned to analytics PR #75's merged main
// SHA. This changes the stored drivers list for real users, so it gets a
// version bump despite being narrative-only, not a headline-score change.
// 95 → 96 (`_resolveOwnership`/substrate splice, accel1Hz/ppgRedIr/
// skinTempRaw priority): `signal_priority` and the device-priority screen are
// generic over every InputSignal a paired device declares, but the substrate
// loader admitted a whole `decoded_onehz` row (accel + ppg + skin-temp
// bundled with hr in one row) purely on the hr1Hz ownership winner for that
// second — a user's explicit accel1Hz/ppgRedIr/skinTempRaw priority order had
// no effect at all. `_resolveOwnership` now resolves those three signals too,
// and a contended second splices each field group in from its OWN owner's row
// when that device has one, instead of following hr1Hz. No output change for
// any single-device install or any pairing where those three signals are not
// actually contended (`group.length < 2` short-circuits to the unchanged row).
// kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin UNCHANGED: edge-only fix.
// 96 → 97 (temp_circadian zero-variance guard, analytics main @ 0441ef9):
// `_nonparam` divided by `varTot/diffN` with no zero-variance guard, so a
// flat or heavily-quantized skin-temp window reported
// interdailyStability=0.0 / intradailyVariability=0.0 as measured instead of
// withheld — a fabricated-metric bug on `circadian_lifestyle`'s stored
// output. kAnalyticsPin repinned to analytics main's tip (one commit past
// PR #75's merge SHA).
// 97 → 98 (daytime stress, edge-only orchestration): the day bundle gains a
// `stress_day` series — the SAME `baevskyStressIndex` the nightly score uses,
// run per 15-minute wall-clock bin of the whole-day cleaned NN and scored with
// the same log [20, 600] → 0–100 map (now one shared `_stressScoreOfSi`). Bins
// too thin for an SI window are `score: null`, never interpolated. The nightly
// `stress` block is unchanged. kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin UNCHANGED.
// 98 → 99 (early readiness estimate, edge-only orchestration): while the
// full composite is cold-starting (need_baseline under analytics' 14 nights),
// the day bundle gains `readiness_early` — the SAME `readinessComposite` over
// the SAME inputs with `minBaseline: kReadinessEarlyMinBaseline` (4), through
// the same z-cap. Bundle-only: never written to the `readiness` series or the
// day_result column, so baselines, streaks, alerts and exports are untouched.
// Home labels it "Early estimate". kAnalyticsPin/kProtocolPin UNCHANGED.
// 99 → 100 (rough-guide readiness, edge-only, the person's explicit choice):
// nights 1–4, before even the early estimate can exist, the bundle gains
// `readiness_rough` — tonight's sleeping RHR and breathing rate as z against
// approximate ADULT reference values (`kRoughRhrMean/Sd`, `kRoughRespMean/Sd`,
// HRV deliberately excluded), the composite's weights and logistic map, the
// same z-cap. Bundle-only, never the readiness series. UI: "Rough guide".
const int kAlgoVersion = 100;
/// The sibling SHAs this version was derived against, asserted against
/// pubspec.yaml in test/db_serve_version_and_reads_test.dart.
///
/// A day_result stamps kAlgoVersion and nothing else, so two builds pinning
/// DIFFERENT analytics at the SAME version serve each other's days as
/// equivalent — and `_pruneOldDecoded` throws the substrate away behind them,
/// so it is not repairable after the fact. That is exactly what happened
/// between v67 and v68. Repinning without touching this block fails the suite,
/// one line above the constant you then have to bump.
// Both siblings move with this bump, and both move NUMBERS this time — which
// is the whole reason the version goes up. analytics: one active-energy gate
// on heart-rate reserve instead of %HRmax (the day and the bout used to
// disagree by 8-35 bpm depending on age and rest), and a measured quiet-waking
// level under strain instead of a population constant that scored a day with
// no activity at all somewhere between 6.9 and 12.1 out of 21. protocol: v25
// stops emitting a gravity vector from offsets that were refuted on real data.
// Both siblings moved again after their own review passes, and kAlgoVersion
// deliberately did NOT: those fixes reject NaN and ±inf, which no sensor ever
// produced and no baseline ever held. For a user whose data is valid, every
// number out of both packages is byte-identical, so a bump would invalidate
// every stored day to recompute the same answers.
//
// This repin picks up the analytics perf pass, and kAlgoVersion holds at 76 for
// the same reason: the stager does the same arithmetic in fewer passes. The one
// place that could have gone wrong was sorting the HR window before `stddev`,
// which re-orders a float summation — that is computed before the sort now, and
// the real overnight capture staged identically down to the last digit of
// confidence.
//
// The protocol repin to b7990e1 also holds at 76, and this one is checkable
// rather than argued: diff the two pins and the gen4 record decoder
// (`lib/src/records.dart`) is untouched, as is every gen4 line in the package
// export. What moved is the gen5 surface — the hello map, the control plane,
// the command surface and the v18/v20/v22/v26 field maps — plus their tests.
// For anyone on a gen4 strap every number out of this package is byte-identical
// across the repin, so a bump would invalidate every stored day to recompute
// the same answers. The gen5 records it adds are new: no released build could
// decode them, so no stored day at v76 was derived from one, and there is
// nothing for a same-version serve to confuse.
//
// The protocol repin to 4ce8f02 (protocol #33 rebased onto b7990e1) holds at
// 76 and is checkable the same way: the whole hop is one commit adding alarm
// COMMAND builders (alarmRev1Payload and friends) plus their exports and
// test. Commands go TO the strap; no decoder line moves, so no stored number
// can.
//
// The analytics repin to a077a4a (the #52 merge, landed via edge#283) is the
// OPPOSITE case from every hop above: it exists to move a number. #52 adds
// the cadence→MET walking term to `Calories.dailyEnergy` (CADENCE-Adults),
// which is exactly what v77 above prices in — the bump and the v77 migration
// cover the hop, and the hop is exactly #52 (diff the two pins: calories.dart
// and its tests, nothing else).
//
// THE ANALYTICS DEBT THIS BLOCK RECORDED IS PAID (v78/v79 above, this
// branch's own work, merged after #283 landed a077a4a on main). Four of the
// items above (A2, A4, C1's window, C9) live in analytics, and for most of
// this branch's life they were UNCOMMITTED: `pubspec_overrides.yaml` pointed
// the local build at `../analytics`, so a dev build already ran them while
// the pin (`d9362a6`) did not contain a line of them — a build shipping this
// constant against that pin would have served days derived from different
// maths under one version number, the exact v67/v68 failure. The pin is
// `d6ba41c` now and carries all four, checkable one at a time:
//   git show d6ba41c:lib/src/onehz/sleep/segment.dart | grep 'valid: trimmedAccel'
//   git show d6ba41c:lib/src/onehz/wellness/readiness_composite.dart \
//     | grep 'readinessCompositeMinBaseline = 14'
//   git show d6ba41c:lib/src/onehz/clinical/nocturnal.dart | grep 'tsSec'
//   git show d6ba41c:lib/src/onehz/util.dart | grep 'sampleCadenceSeconds'
// The guard test compares this constant to pubspec.yaml and would not have
// caught the gap — both were consistent the whole time. Whether the pinned SHA
// contains the change a bump CITES is still a thing a human checks; v43 shipped
// a changelog for an analytics fix its pin never had, and the bug it claimed to
// fix stayed live for three releases.
// Repin to analytics main @ #51 merge (7105256), review-fix pin for this
// branch's own PR (#280). #51 is a strict descendant of a077a4a (#51 merged
// AFTER #52 on analytics main), so this pin carries the walking term too —
// no separate hop needed. No further kAlgoVersion move for THIS repin: the
// only lib/ diff over 353c6bc is #52's `Calories.dailyEnergy` gaining an
// optional `cadenceSpmPerMin` param and a `walking` result field (both edge
// call sites use named field access and never pass the new param), so with
// no caller passing it `active`/`basal`/`total` are byte-identical to before
// — the walking-cadence NUMBER change already happened at v77 above, via
// #283's own a077a4a pin, before this branch's pin moved past it.
// Repin to analytics main @ #53 merge (187e026), one hop on top of 7105256.
// This is the v80 PIN GATE above being closed: #53 lands `nnTimesMs` on
// `irregularBeatScreen`, which onehz_pipeline.dart (this same v80 change) was
// already calling — the pin was never moved when kAlgoVersion went to 80, so
// a clean checkout failed `flutter analyze` (undefined_named_parameter) and
// would have recomputed v80 against a sibling without the sustained-window
// fix it claims. No other symbol changed; no further kAlgoVersion move.
//
// REPIN (this branch) @ 6664854 — protocol main at the OpenStrap/protocol#35
// merge commit ("record HELLO revision instead of gating parsing"). The old
// pin's parser returned null for any hello body whose revision byte was not
// 1; this branch makes HELLO MANDATORY, so under that gate a firmware that
// bumped the revision could not connect at all. #35 records the byte in
// `helloRevision` and reads the fixed revision-1 offsets regardless.
//
// The hop from 19d7291 is ahead 3 / behind 0, and its ONLY lib/ diff is

// The other two commits are the #34 merge (2c8448b), whose head 19d7291 this
// pin already WAS, so the oura/generic-HRS wire formats edge#280 imports come

// moves, so no stored number can. This constant moves together with
