// notification_center.dart — the single emitter.
//
// Every insight and alert goes through emit(). OS-level notifications are the
// ONLY surface now — the in-app notifications feed/screen was removed (it
// duplicated the OS notification with no independent value).
//
// emit() is the PRESENT path. The standing schedules further down
// (scheduleStandingReminders, scheduleAiReminders) are the SCHEDULE path, which
// never passes through emit at all: the OS fires those with no Dart running.
// They are gated by NotificationService.schedulableIds instead.
//
// Whether an emitted event fires an OS notification is decided by
// NotificationPrefs:
//   • it must be one of the four sanctioned NotifClasses (see classOf), AND
//   • its category must be enabled, AND
//   • either we're outside quiet hours, or the event is critical and the user
//     allowed critical-overrides-quiet.
// The alarm is exempt from the last two: the user armed it for a time that is
// usually inside their own quiet window.
//
// Emit sites that are no longer one of the three (recovery-ready, step goal,
// posture, "did you work out?") still call emit() and are dropped HERE rather
// than at each site — one gate is how the rule stays true when the next emit
// site is added.
