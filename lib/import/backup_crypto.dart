// Passphrase-encrypted backup.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. The Data screen hands a raw SQLite file to the OS share
// sheet, correctly described as "the complete copy" — every journal note, every
// medication dose, every cycle entry, every GPS route. Putting that in iCloud
// or Drive puts a complete health record in someone else's storage in plain
// text. This makes the file unreadable without a passphrase.
//
// AND THE COST, stated as plainly as the benefit: A FORGOTTEN PASSPHRASE MEANS
// THE BACKUP IS GONE. There is no recovery, because there is no account and no
// server holding a key — which is the same property that makes the product
// private. So: NO HINT FIELD, NO RECOVERY CODE. Both make it feel safer while
// making it weaker, and a hint is the single most effective attack on a
// human-chosen passphrase.
//
// The plaintext `.db` option STAYS. It is the lossless, tool-readable format,
// some people want exactly that, and it is the only thing that still opens if
// this file's format is ever wrong.
//
// CONSTRUCTION — all standard, nothing improvised:
//   AES-256-GCM  (vetted AEAD; the tag is the tamper check)
//   PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 210 000 iterations (OWASP's 2023 floor for this PRF)
//   a fresh 16-byte salt AND a fresh 12-byte nonce PER FILE, from the platform
//   CSPRNG. Never derived from the passphrase, never a counter, never reused —
//   a repeated (key, nonce) pair in GCM is a catastrophic break, not a weakness.
//   The whole header is authenticated as AAD, so the iteration count and salt
//   cannot be edited to steer a later decrypt.
//
// NOT Argon2id: a pure-Dart Argon2id is slow enough on a phone that it gets
// tuned down until it is worth less than the PBKDF2 it replaced.
//
// STREAMING, deliberately. A VACUUM'd export of a real database runs to
// hundreds of megabytes; reading one into a list to encrypt it is an
// out-of-memory crash on the device where it matters most.
//
// MEASURED THROUGHPUT — read this before wiring a caller. Pure-Dart AES-GCM
// runs at about **1.5 MB/s**: a real 133 MB gen4 export took 88 s to encrypt
// and 81 s to decrypt on a desktop, and a phone is slower. Byte-exact both
// ways, so this is a cost, not a defect — but it is a cost with consequences:
//   * A deliberate, user-initiated backup with a progress indicator is fine.
//   * AUTO-BACKUP MUST NOT DEFAULT TO ENCRYPTED. A silent scheduled job that
//     pins a core for ten minutes on a 600 MB database is a battery bug, and
//     the restore path has to have run green against a file written by a
//     PREVIOUS app version before any default changes.
//
// ponytail: pure-Dart AES-GCM at ~1.5 MB/s; the upgrade path is a
// platform-backed AEAD (`cryptography_flutter` delegates to CommonCrypto /
// javax.crypto and is ~50x faster), at the cost of a platform channel that
// cannot be round-tripped in a headless test. Take it only if the measured
// wait is what people actually complain about.
