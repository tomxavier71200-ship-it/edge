// Prefs — a tiny synchronous façade over SharedPreferences for UI selection
// state (selected tab, per-metric range toggles, etc.). Local-first, no auth.
//
// Screens need to RESTORE a saved selection in initState() without an async gap
// (which would flash the default first). So we keep a cached SharedPreferences
// instance, loaded once at startup via [ensureLoaded] (awaited in main before
// runApp). Reads are then synchronous; writes persist in the background.
//
// If a screen is somehow built before [ensureLoaded] completes, reads fall back
// to the provided default — never throws, never blocks.
