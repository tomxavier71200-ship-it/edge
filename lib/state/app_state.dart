  //   IMU ← a gait workout in the FOREGROUND, a bounded movement-sampling
  //         window, or the passive strap-step opt-in (off).
  //   An ordinary foreground connection owns nothing on gen5: the on-chip daily
  //   counter is the step fallback and the phone can supply windowed steps.

  //   the EdgeTracking foreground service keeps the process alive without any
  //   inbound stream, on iOS the band's prompt wakes it; the 1 Hz stream with
  //   no consumer was ~86,400 wakes a day either way. Liveness
