//
//  The palette, the snapshot reader and the ring, shared by every widget that
//  renders what the app publishes into the App Group (OpenStrapWidget, the
//  Sleep widget and the Overnight widget). One namespace rather than free
//  functions and `extension Color` statics, because the Live Activity files
//  already own a `Pal` and a `Color.ink` of their own and two of those in one
//  module is a fight nobody wins.
//
//  WHAT THIS SIDE IS ALLOWED TO DECIDE: layout, and nothing else. The numbers,
//  their labels, what they are out of, whether a ring is a reading or
//  calibration progress, and why one is missing all arrive already resolved —
//  see `WidgetService.push` (lib/widget/widget_service.dart), which mirrors
//  `RingTrio` on Home. Rules that used to live here in Swift AND in Kotlin AND
//  in Dart disagreed about the same day; there is one copy now.
