// R2 wiring regressions — the numbers the screens were reading wrong.
//
// Each group below pins one bug that shipped, so the fix cannot quietly come
// undone:
//
//  · the cross-day rollup was served VERBATIM, with no version and no date, so
//    every readiness driver, the sleep coach and the body clock could be weeks
//    old under an older algorithm with nothing on screen to say so;
//  · chart points lost their timestamps, so "Today" and "N days ago" were
//    counted off the ARRAY INDEX and a sync gap read as continuous;
//  · the sleep trend captioned itself "vs your need" while subtracting the
//    28-day average;
//  · "days with a derived record in the last month" counted every derived day
//    since install, so anyone past their first month read "30 of 30".
