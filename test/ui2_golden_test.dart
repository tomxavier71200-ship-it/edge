// Goldens for the grammar.
//
// The repo had ZERO goldens across forty screens, which is the mechanical
// reason every visual fix regressed something else: nothing recorded what the
// components were supposed to look like, so "it looks right on my screen" was
// the whole acceptance test.
//
// Each component is captured in four states — light and dark, at 1.0× and
// 2.0× text scale. The 2.0× pass is not decoration: accessibility text sizes
// are where cards overflow, and a golden is the only cheap way to notice.
//
// Regenerate deliberately, never reflexively:
//     flutter test --update-goldens test/ui2_golden_test.dart
// and look at the diff. A golden updated without looking is a golden that
// records the bug.
//
// These were baked on Flutter 3.44.9 (the `flutter` on PATH). An older SDK
// anti-aliases hairlines differently and fails a handful of them on nothing
// but sub-pixel blend — that is an SDK mismatch, not a regression. The iOS
// build uses ~/flutter-sdks/flutter (3.41.6) for an unrelated reason; do not
// run goldens with it.
